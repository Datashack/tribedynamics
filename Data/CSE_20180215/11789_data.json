Take note, tell your friends and shop a little greener...\n\nWhat Are Petrochemicals?\n\n\nPetrochemicals are chemicals derived from petroleum. Nearly all beauty products contain them. Although hard for some to imagine, almost all synthetic (man-made) chemicals are petrochemicals, unless they\u2019re derived from an alternative such as coconuts or vegetables. And even those \u201cnaturally-derived\u201d ingredients can still have petrochemical components depending on the processes used to derive them.\nThe most well-known petrochemical ingredient is petrolatum, commonly used in beauty products like lotions as a moisturizing agent.\nPetrochemical ingredients are used in abundance because they\u2019re relatively cheap to manufacture and can be used for a range of functions: ... to give a certain texture; or to disperse fragrance ingredients.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Concern?\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that not all petrochemicals are linked to human health problems. The problem often comes with refining: When petrochemicals aren\u2019t properly refined, they can be contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a class of chemicals linked to cancer[1]. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no way to know if a chemical has been properly refined unless the manufacturer requests its full refinement history, so it\u2019s virtually impossible for consumers to know if their petrochemical products are clean or contaminated.\n\n5 Common Petrochemicals to Know\n\nSome common petrochemicals linked to health problems that aren\u2019t permitted in MADE SAFE certified products:\nMineral oil | Eye shadow, blush, concealer, lip ... shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotions. Endocrine disruptors linked to cancer[4].\nPhthalates | Found in fragrance.\n\nHow to Avoid Them\n\n  \nBecause petrochemicals are so ubiquitous and it\u2019s difficult for the average shopper to know what\u2019s safe and what\u2019s not, here are a ... regarding a medical condition, and before undertaking any diet, exercise or other health related program. \nThe post Toxic Timeout: 5 Petrochemicals in Beauty to Know + Avoid appeared first on The Chalkboard.", "link": "http://thechalkboardmag.com/petrochemicals-in-beauty", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Age should never be part of the equation \ud83d\udc96 RoC Skincare Complete Skin MD", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/35370009210/posts/10155343287134211", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Flashback: RoC Max Wrinkle Resurfacing System Review", "link": "https://www.twitter.com/weheartthis/statuses/955977571438596096", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "RoC Multi-Correxion 5-in-1 BB Cream | Review  #Archive", "link": "https://www.twitter.com/voxielle/statuses/960374839881224193", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "#retinol should be part of everyone\u2019s #skincareroutine and rocskincare is my go-to when it comes...", "link": "https://www.twitter.com/nsdbeauty/statuses/958768669059944448", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "@nsdbeauty Retinol is fantastic!
