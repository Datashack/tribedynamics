My nightmares, however, became my obsession.\u00a0His name is Michael Crist.\u00a0My boyfriend\u2019s older brother is like that scary movie that you peek through your hand to watch. He is handsome, strong, and completely terrifying. The star of his college\u2019s basketball team and now gone pro, he\u2019s more concerned with the dirt on his shoe than me.\u00a0But I noticed him.I saw him. I heard him. The things that he did, and the deeds that he hid\u2026For years, I bit my nails, unable to look away.\u00a0Now, I\u2019ve graduated high school and moved on to college, but I haven\u2019t stopped watching Michael. He\u2019s bad, and the dirt I\u2019ve seen isn\u2019t content to stay in my head anymore.\u00a0Because he\u2019s finally noticed me.\u00a0MichaelHer name is Erika Fane, but everyone calls her Rika.My brother\u2019s girlfriend grew up hanging around my house and is always at our dinner table. She looks down when I enter a room and stills when I am close. I can always feel the fear rolling off of her, and while I haven\u2019t had her body, I know that I have her mind. That\u2019s all I really want anyway.\u00a0Until my brother leaves for the military, and I find Rika alone at college.\u00a0In my city.\u00a0Unprotected.\u00a0The opportunity is too good to be true as well as the timing. Because you see, three years ago she put a few of my high school friends in prison, and now they\u2019re out.\u00a0We\u2019ve waited. We\u2019ve been patient. And now every last one of her nightmares will come true.\u00a0\"I fell back to my feet and crept through my apartment as I listened to the pounding that had now become a steady attack. My feet followed the sound, stepping absently closer to it, and I finally pressed my ear against the wall leading to my hallway, my heart racing as the vibrations touched my skin.\u00a0Resting my cheek against the surface, I swallowed the tight lump in my throat as the thumping against the wall grew faster and faster.\u00a0There was someoneover there. In the empty apartment.\u00a0Holding up my phone, I dialed the office downstairs but got no answer. I knew there was a night manager named Simon Something-Or-Other, but I didn\u2019t think many people were on duty at night. He must be away from his desk.\u00a0I continued listening, wondering if I could ignore it and just wait until morning to ask the manager about it, but the further down the hall I travelled, the louder it got until I was standing next to the rear entrance.\u00a0Opening up the door, I peeked my head into the hallway, holding the heavy steel exit open just enough to inspect.\u00a0Glancing to my right, I saw a door just like mine. And then I heard a woman\u2019s high-pitched cry ring out around me, and I started breathing harder.\u00a0And then there was another cry. And another, and another, and...Was she having sex? My mouth fell open as I tried not to laugh.\u00a0 Oh, my God.\u00a0But I thought theplace was supposed to be empty.\u00a0I steppedout, knife in hand\u2014just in case\u2014and walked quietly down to the other door, glancing up and seeing small security cameras along the wall, probably installed when the apartments were built.\u00a0Pressing my ear to the door, I listened, still hearing the thump, thump, thump of something hitting the wall, and the girl\u2019s breathy cries over and over again.\u00a0I folded my lips between my teeth, covering my smile with my free hand.\u00a0But then the woman cried out. \u201c No! Ah, oh, God! Please!\u201d And my face fell, hearing the fear in her voice. The short, shrill screams were now different. Panicked and scared, and her cries sounded struggled. My mouth suddenly went dry as I stood there listening.\u00a0\u201c Ah!\u201d  she cried out again. \u201c No, please stop!\u201d I backed away from the door, not finding it funny anymore.\u00a0But then somethinghit the door from the other side, making a loud thud, and I scurried backward. \u201c Oh, shit,\u201d I gritted out under my breath.\u00a0I shot my head upto the cameras, now wondering if they fed to Security downstairs or to whoever was inside the apartment. Did they know I was out here?\u00a0I spun around and dashed for my door, grabbing the handle and trying to twist it.\u00a0But it was locked. \u201c Dammit!\u201d  I mouthed. Fucking thing must lock automatically.\u00a0Another thud hit the door, mere feet away from me\u2014so close\u2014and I darted my eyes over to it, my breathing turning fast and painful.\u00a0I pulled on the door handle again, twisting and yanking, but it didn\u2019t budge.\u00a0Another thud hit the door, and I jerked upright, dropping the knife.\u00a0\u201c Shit.\u201d I dived down to pick it up, but just then I heard the other door swing open, so I bolted down the stairwell, hiding behind the wall and forgetting about the knife.\u00a0Fuck!Screw this. Whoever was coming out of the vacant apartment was definitely someone I didn\u2019t want to meet. I dashed down flight after flight, a cry lodged in my throat as fear gripped my chest.\u00a0A pounding echoed above me, and I spared a quick glance upward, seeing a hand sliding down the railings as whoever it was jumped flights of stairs.", "link": "http://littlebookwormreviews.blogspot.com/2015/12/blog-tour-corrupt-by-penelope-douglas.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "daily sunscreen with Zinc oxide and Titanium dioxide as the active ingredients can calm the skin and prevent facial flushing.

Hiding from the past with her father and twin brother, Vayda knows the rules: never return to the town of her mother\u2019s murder, and never work a Mind Game where someone might see.No one can know the toll emotions take on Vayda, how emotion becomes energy in her hands, or how she can\u2019t control the destruction she causes.

He ascended to executive sous chef at Tavern on the Green, where he managed an eighty-person staff. He has worked in the kitchens of Morgans Hotel Group, 10 Downing in Manhattan, and Governor in Brooklyn\u2019s DUMBO, among many others. Over the course of his career, he has had the opportunity to work alongside cooks and chefs from many of the nation\u2019s best restaurants, including Alinea, Per Se, Eleven Madison Park, Daniel, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, Bouley, Ducasse, Corton, wd~50, and Momofuku.\nIn addition to his experience in the food service industry, Gibney also holds a BFA in painting from Pratt Institute and an MFA in nonfiction writing from Columbia University. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nConnect with the Author: Twitter | Facebook | Goodreads\n\u00a0\nWould You Rather With Michael Gibney\n\u00a0\nWould you rather never be able to speak again or always have to say everything that is on your mind?\nEverything that is on my mind. I value honesty and the power of words, both written and audible. It\u2019s not in my nature to stay silent, especially concerning injustice i.e. Animal Cruelty, etc.\n\u00a0\nWould you rather be able to read or be able to read minds (but be illiterate)?\nI can do both. Haha. Read. I\u2019d find reading people\u2019s minds an invasion of their privacy, unless it was to help them.\n\u00a0\nWould you rather be able to speak fluently every language in the world or be the best in the world at something of your choosing? \nBe the best in the world at something. Reason being I love the fact that learning another language is a feeling of achievement and an exciting challenge. I wouldn\u2019t want that challenge made easy.\n\u00a0\nWould you rather read only one book over and over for the rest of your life or read as many as you want but never remember what they\u2019re about?\nOh, tough one. Well, if you can\u2019t remember there\u2019s not much point. Seems like a waste of time and effort for nothing, so I\u2019d go for reading one book and that would be J.M. Barrie\u2019s Peter Pan (aka Peter and Wendy). The best fantasy book ever written in my opinion. So simple but yet such Genius.\n\u00a0\nWould you rather only the first page of a book or the last page?\nLast Page. I always have to find out how a story ends.\n\u00a0\nWould you rather read 5 pages per day or 5 books per week?\nFive books a week if I could and had the time. Knowledge is power.\n\u00a0\nWould you rather read only one genre forever or never read the same genre more than once? \nOne genre forever because you\u2019d quickly run out of genres, right? And there\u2019s plenty of amazing books and various sub-genres to be found in the Sci-Fi and Horror genre. Not so much in the romance genre.\n\u00a0\nWould you rather be invisible or be able to read minds?\nInvisible. Would be so much fun but not if it\u2019s like the Predator or Hollowman/The Invisible Man. That would suck.\n\u00a0\nWould you rather never use the internet again or never watch TV again?\nNever watch TV again. There\u2019s too much sad news and superficial reality shows on TV these days and not to mention a cluster of commercials. Yes, give me the Internet, so I can watch the art, music, movies I want and keep in contact with those I love around the world. Much better than a one way street of TV.\n\u00a0\nWould you rather have one wish granted today or three granted in 10 years?\nDefinitely one wish granted today. Life is unpredictable and short. We\u2019re not guaranteed anything. Also, I hate waiting. Patience is a virtue. Possess it if you can. Seldom in a woman, but never in a man.\n\u00a0\nWould you rather know it all or have it all?\nHave it all. I\u2019m a deep enough thinker and have a strong enough imagination as it is and that can be quite exhausting. So, knowing it all would drive me crazy. Plus, one would be viewed as pretentious and arrogant if they had the ability to know it all. And both are not good attributes. =)\n\u00a0\n\n\nThree brothers born to a once powerful King were abandoned at birth and cast out into the old world as orphans \u2013 alone and unaware of the other\u2019s existence or their royal heritage.\nIn the new world, by order of the false King, three of the most lethal assassins are sent to kill the children before they come of age and avenge their father\u2019s throne.\nBut when the brothers find one another, Benjamin, Tommy and Sebastian must resist the temptation of magic and power if they are to defeat the unspeakable evil that has threatened them since birth.\nThe Three Thorns is book one in an exciting children\u2019s fantasy ", "link": "http://dianasbookreviews.com/super-middle-grade-mondays-author-spotlight-michael-gibney-giveaway-supermgmondays/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Amazon Toy Lightning Deals December 12th Here are today's\u00a0Amazon Toy Lightning Deals! *Keep in mind we do not know the discounted price until the toy's lightning deal is activated so you will need to check back in on your favorites.PRIME EARLY ACCESS DEAL\u2013 give those members access 30 minutes earlier than the listed time.*NOTE \u2013 Central Standard TimePRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALSave 30% Off The Anatex Deluxe Mini Play CubeStarts for Prime members at 8:00amThe Learning Journey Techno Gears Marble Mania VoyagerStarts at 8:00amPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALTransformers 4 Age of Extinction, Exclusive Evolution 2-Pack, Bum...Starts for Prime members at 8:05amWinmau Blade 4 Bristle DartboardStarts at 8:25amJumpSport The Fitness Trampoline Model 220 Non-Folding 40-Inch T...Starts at 8:25amPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALSpyX / Night Mission GogglesStarts for Prime members at 9:00amWhite Mountain Puzzles Old Grist Mill - 1000 Piece Jigsaw PuzzleStarts at 9:05amKid's Fire Truck Collapsible Toy Storage Organizer - Cushion TopStarts at 9:05amPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALiSaddle Maple Wooden Fingerboard with Blue Bearing Wheels Nuts T...Starts for Prime members at 9:05am10\" x 10\" Blue Stackable Construction Base Plates - 4 Pac...Starts at 9:05amPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALHandcrafted Nautical Decor RMS Titanic Cruise Ship, 14\"Starts for Prime members at 9:05amLiquitex BASICS Acrylic Paint Tube 4 oz, 6-Piece SetStarts at 9:40amPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALHandcrafted Nautical Decor HMS Victory Ship, 14\"Starts for Prime members at 10:05amPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALInfantino Stick and Spin High Chair PalStarts for Prime members at 11:00amPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEAL70 pc American Revolution PlaysetStarts for Prime members at 11:05amPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALChalkboard Calendar with Memo Wall DecalStarts for Prime members at 11:30amPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALStuffed Animal OrganizerStarts for Prime members at 12:00pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALPlaygro Jungle Friends Gift PackStarts for Prime members at 2:00pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALNever Have I Ever - The Classic Game for AdultsStarts for Prime members at 12:05pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALThe Bridge Direct Hobbit 15\" Dwarven Battle AxeStarts for Prime members at 12:05pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALPower Rangers Samurai Vehicle Action Figure LightZord Super Me...Starts for Prime members at 1:05pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALHandcrafted Nautical Decor Whale Wars Steve Irwin Famous Ships,...Starts for Prime members at 1:05pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALRubber Loom Band Refill Kit with Reusable Designer HandbagStarts for Prime members at 3:05pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALTechege Toys Walking Brachiosaurus DinosaurStarts for Prime members at 3:05pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALDuracell Coppertop AA Batteries, 20-CountStarts for Prime members at 3:45pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALInStep Take 2 Double Bicycle TrailerStarts for Prime members at 5:00pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALTeamson Kids Fancy Mansion Wooden Doll House with FurnitureStarts for Prime members at 5:05pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALAngry Birds Transformers Telepods Ultra Magnus Bird vs. SoundBlas...Starts for Prime members at 5:05pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALHandcrafted Nautical Decor Bluenose Sailboat, 50\"Starts for Prime members at 5:05pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALFranklin Sports Disney Frozen Size 3 Soft Foam Air Tech Soccer Ball ...Starts for Prime members at 6:05pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALTeamson Kids Fashion Prints Jewelry Armoire - Zebra (Aqua Blu...Starts for Prime members at 6:35pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALPeaceable Kingdom / The Great Cheese Chase Cooperative Gam...Starts for Prime members at 7:05pmPRIME EARLY ACCESS DEALLifetime Monkey Bar Adventure Swing Set, Primary ColorsStarts for Prime members at 7:25pmCheck out all of the deals\u00a0HERE!Be sure to check each of these following pages for the best Amazon Deals!Amazon Toy DealsAmazon Laptop DealsAmazon TV DealsAmazon Gold Box DealsTop Holiday DealsPLUS you can check out the\u00a0Amazon 2015 Toy List\u00a0HERE!Ships FREE with $35 qualifying purchase or with an\u00a0Amazon Prime membership.

My nightmares, however, became my obsession.\nHis name is Michael Crist.\nMy boyfriend\u2019s older brother is like that scary movie that you peek through your hand to watch. He is handsome, strong, and completely terrifying. The star of his college\u2019s basketball team and now gone pro, he\u2019s more concerned with the dirt on his shoe than me.\nBut I noticed him.\nI saw him. I heard him. The things that he did, and the deeds that he hid\u2026For years, I bit my nails, unable to look away.\nNow, I\u2019ve graduated high school and moved on to college, but I haven\u2019t stopped watching Michael.

She looks down when I enter a room and stills when I am close. I can always feel the fear rolling off of her, and while I haven\u2019t had her body, I know that I have her mind. That\u2019s all I really want anyway.\nUntil my brother leaves for the military, and I find Rika alone at college.\nIn my city.\nUnprotected.\nThe opportunity is too good to be true as well as the timing. Because you see, three years ago she put a few of my high school friends in prison, and now they\u2019re out.\nWe\u2019ve waited. We\u2019ve been patient.

The doors opened as soon as I pushed the button, and I stepped inside, trying to calm my racing heart.\nThey still intimidated me.\nAnd excited me. And challenged me. And knotted me up.\nI\u2019d kind of wanted to go to a party but not with them.\nThe doors started closing, but just then a hand shot into the elevator, and I jumped, seeing the doors re-open. I sucked in a breath, staring wide-eyed as Michael reached in, grabbed my shirt by the collar with one hand, and pulled me out.\n\u201cMichael!\u201d I shouted.\nI stumbled into him, and before I knew what was happening, he grabbed my wrists and locked them behind my back, walking into me and forcing me backward, back down the hall toward the kitchen.\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d I demanded, my lips brushing the tip of his chin.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, guys,\u201d he teased over my head, \u201cshe still seems pretty fucking easy to push around. What do you think?\u201d\nLaughter greeted me as he forced me back into the living area.\nEvery muscle in my body was on fire, and the tips of my toes kept getting caught under his sneakers.\nI twisted my body, trying to break his hold. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d\nI pushed against his chest and jerked my body to the left, tearing out of his hold with every muscle I could muster.\nI stumbled, losing my balance, and fell backward, crashing to the floor. Pain shot through my ass, running down my legs as the fall knocked the wind out me.\nShit!\nShooting my hands behind me, I pushed myself up and bent my knees, looking up at him as he advanced.\nHe stalked over and then stopped, towering over me. \u00a0I immediately moved my hands and feet, crawling backward, away from him.\nBut then I felt something at my back, and I halted. I twisted my head, seeing a dark pant leg, and I didn\u2019t know if it was Damon, Will, or Kai, but it didn\u2019t matter. I was closed in.\nOh, no. I slowly raised my eyes, seeing Michael\u2019s lips tilt in a devious smile. I stopped breathing, seeing him lower his body to the floor, planting his knees between my bent legs, and his hands at my sides.\nMy neck arched back as his face hovered over mine, but I tried to keep myself up as much as possible, no matter how close his body got.\n\u201cI thought you were one of us,\u201d his whispered, his breath caressing my lips. \u201cI thought you could play.\u201d\nI stilled, staring into his eyes.\nYou\u2019re one of us now. Will had said that to me on that night so long ago.\nMichael\u2019s amber eyes searched mine and then dropped to my mouth, his breathing growing heavy as he stared at me like he was about to take a bite.\nI wanted to cry. What the hell was going on?\nThree years ago was nearly the happiest night of my life, and it quickly became the worst. And ever since then, Michael not only acted as if I didn\u2019t exist, but also, at times, as if he wished I didn\u2019t.\nNow the guys were free, and they were all back together again. What did I have to do with any of this? What did he want with me?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know this game,\u201d I told him, barely audible.\nHe stared into my eyes, thinning his own as if studying me. \u201cAll you need to know,\u201d he finally answered, \u201cis that you can\u2019t tap out.\u201d\n\n\n\nPenelope Douglas is the New York Times, USA Today", "link": "http://bookloversforlife.com/2015/11/17/release-corrupt-penelope-douglas/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "The superpowers all against each other in civil peace?

Leaving a sold-out show in Phoenix, he rents a car and drives north and east, landing in the Painted Desert town of Rainbow Rock.    Nearly three years after leaving her old life behind, Lottie Beale is feeding people and baking pies, managing the Kachina Caf\u00e9 and tending secrets of her own. When circumstances conspire to give two attractive people some time alone together amid the world-class vistas of the Four Corners, they discover more than either had bargained for.  Amazon * Barnes & Noble  \u00a0     Excerpt    \u201cRo-man! Ro-man!\u201d A capacity crowd in the Ak-Chin Pavilion chanted his name under the starry desert sky, but Roman Kincaid barely heard it. He stood in the stage wings, gearing up for an encore and wondering when his dream had become a nightmare.  \u201cOkay, guys,\u201d he said to his back-up band via their ear buds. \u201cOne encore only. Let\u2019s do \u2018Gamble.\u2019 Start with the chorus.\u201d He took two steps toward the stage entrance, swinging his guitar into playing position.  Sam, his manager, caught his elbow. \u201cAre you sure about this? That crowd adores you. You could probably play three encores, sell more CDs\u2014\u201d  \u201cNo.\u201d Roman left no room for argument. \u201cOne and done. And no backstage stuff, either. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d He took a deep breath, pasted on the same fake, crowd-pleasing smile he\u2019d used in the last half-dozen shows, and jogged back onto the stage to the roar of twenty thousand excited voices. He strummed the intro and launched into the chorus of his first number-one hit:  \u201cLove is such a gamble.  You break a new deck every time.  Sometimes you\u2019re dealt the aces;  Others you draw to nines.  But when I met you, I knew it was true.  A winning hand you seemed.  Now I have the rush of a royal flush.  You are the gamble of my dreams.\u201d  The crowd cheered wildly as he played his way through the music he now sang in his sleep. In fact, he realized as he watched fans taking up the beat and clapping along, that was pretty much what he was doing now. He struggled to suppress a yawn during the guitar interlude as he turned to acknowledge his band.  I spent my early life dreaming of a crowd like this. When did performing start to feel like a chore? He put the thought away. Lately he\u2019d been thinking of times when he\u2019d heard of some celebrity being hospitalized for exhaustion and assumed it was a euphemism for drug rehab. Now he wondered. When was the last time I felt truly rested? The question was an imponderable. Months, at least.  He hit the last chord and took a deep bow, then shouted, \u201cThank you, Phoenix!\u201d and dashed off-stage.         \u00a0     Author Susan Aylworth   Susan Aylworth started her first book when she was nine. \"It was called Buff, The Proud Stallion. I wrote eight whole pages.\" For her fifth grade career day, she stated her ambition to become \"a rich and famous author.\" Decades later, she is pleased to have achieved the 'author' part of that goal. A former university professor, she enjoys researching backgrounds and careers for her novels. \"It's one way to live many lives at once.\" She lives in northern California with her husband of 45 years and two spoiled cats.

Characters like the Doll-Maker who have promised us great things in exchange for our trust. Moments of bleak darkness and desperation, with only blind faith to guide us to an uncertain future. \u00a0I guess you could say certain aspects of my own life are reflected here.\"    The first thing that draws me to a book is its cover. \u00a0Can you tell us about your cover for The Skull Collector - why you chose that concept and who the artist is.\"This sombre, macabre cover was illustrated and created by Yosbe Design, to whom I am deeply grateful. \u00a0It illustrates the pain and sorrow of the main character as it is in the novel perfectly, along with her only friend and companion. \u00a0As such, I think the cover is an excellent representation of what lies in the pages beyond. \u00a0I love it.\"    Why should we read The Skull Collector and what sets it apart from the rest?  What makes your book unique?\"If you like dark, fantastical worlds in which strange, quirky characters and monsters abound, where happiness is an ugly word an hope a mere glint in a dark sky then you might like it. \u00a0The Skull Collector is its own tale, though I've heard the name Tim Burton mentioned in its style.\"    Who would you recommend The Skull Collector to and what should readers be aware of (any warnings or disclaimers)?\"I'd recommend it to lovers of gothic, macabre, dark fantasy fiction. \u00a0The only thing I would warn readers about is that it can, at times, be a little unapologetically violent. \u00a0That said, the violence is necessary, I think.\"What do you like to write and read about? Do you stick to a particular genre or do you like to explore different ones?\"Well, I don't really think of genre when I write. \u00a0I just think of stories I'd like to read, worlds I like seeing in my own mind. \u00a0These do, admittedly, tend to drift towards the dark side of fiction, however. \u00a0That said, many of my favorite authors do write paranormal, dark, horror, mystery books. \u00a0I guess its something I'm drawn to.\"What is your writing process?\"I tend to stare into space until I can place myself inside the story. \u00a0From there, I'll try to describe what I see, smell and hear as much as I'm able to. \u00a0Like  a fly on the wall, I guess.\"    What is in store next?\"I have a paranormal thriller novel being released probably early next year called \u00a0'The Regulars', and I'm currently working on another dark fantasy novel, which I'm having fun with, despite it's sinister moments. \u00a0After that I'll continue with a horror set in Victorian London, and a couple other projects.\"    And as a final quirky thing, to get to know you a little bit better... do you have a pet or something that is special to you that you could share with us?\"There aren't many photos of me out there (or anywhere), but I did steal this one of Kitty when she was basking in the sun.\"     The Skull CollectorAvailable NOW!UK:     US:     back to top ", "link": "http://bookschatter.blogspot.com/2015/12/Q-A-skull-collector.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Kindergarten Prep!

I\u2019d find reading people\u2019s minds an invasion of their privacy, unless it was to help them.\u00a0 Would you rather be able to speak fluently every language in the world or be the best in the world at something of your choosing? Be the best in the world at something. Reason being I love the fact that learning another language is a feeling of achievement and an exciting challenge. I wouldn\u2019t want that challenge made easy.\u00a0 Would you rather read only one book over and over for the rest of your life or read as many as you want but never remember what they\u2019re about?Oh, tough one. Well, if you can\u2019t remember there\u2019s not much point. Seems like a waste of time and effort for nothing, so I\u2019d go for reading one book and that would be J.M. Barrie\u2019s Peter Pan (aka Peter and Wendy). The best fantasy book ever written in my opinion. So simple but yet such Genius.\u00a0 Would you rather only the first page of a book or the last page?Last Page. I always have to find out how a story ends.\u00a0 Would you rather read 5 pages per day or 5 books per week?Five books a week if I could and had the time. Knowledge is power.\u00a0 Would you rather read only one genre forever or never read the same genre more than once? One genre forever because you\u2019d quickly run out of genres, right? And there\u2019s plenty of amazing books and various sub-genres to be found in the Sci-Fi and Horror genre. Not so much in the romance genre.\u00a0 Would you rather be invisible or be able to read minds?Invisible. Would be so much fun but not if it\u2019s like the Predator or Hollowman/The Invisible Man. That would suck.\u00a0 Would you rather never use the internet again or never watch TV again?Never watch TV again. There\u2019s too much sad news and superficial reality shows on TV these days and not to mention a cluster of commercials. Yes, give me the Internet, so I can watch the art, music, movies I want and keep in contact with those I love around the world. Much better than a one way street of TV.\u00a0 Would you rather have one wish granted today or three granted in 10 years?Definitely one wish granted today. Life is unpredictable and short. We\u2019re not guaranteed anything. Also, I hate waiting. Patience is a virtue. Possess it if you can. Seldom in a woman, but never in a man.\u00a0 Would you rather know it all or have it all?Have it all. I\u2019m a deep enough thinker and have a strong enough imagination as it is and that can be quite exhausting. So, knowing it all would drive me crazy. Plus, one would be viewed as pretentious and arrogant if they had the ability to know it all. And both are not good attributes. =)\u00a0 Three brothers born to a once powerful King were abandoned at birth and cast out into the old world as orphans - alone and unaware of the other's existence or their royal heritage.In the new world, by order of the false King, three of the most lethal assassins are sent to kill the children before they come of age and avenge their father\u2019s throne.But when the brothers find one another, Benjamin, Tommy and Sebastian must resist the temptation of magic and power if they are to defeat the unspeakable evil that has threatened them since birth.The Three Thorns is book one in an exciting children\u2019s fantasy series called The Brotherhood and the Shield from debut author Michael Gibney.Chapters Indigo | Amazon | Barnes & Noble | Kobo |", "link": "http://avidbookcollector.blogspot.com/2015/11/super-middle-grade-mondays-author.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Review: Between Shades of Gray by Ruta Sepetys \nPublisher:\u00a0Puffin books\nRelease Date: April 1st, 2011\nFormat:\u00a0Paperback\nISBN:\u00a09780857572301\nPages:\u00a0344\nGoodreads | Book Depository\n\nLina is just like any other fifteen-year-old Lithuanian girl in 1941. She paints, she draws, she gets crushes on boys. Until one night when Soviet officers barge into her home, tearing her family from the comfortable life they\u2019ve known. Separated from her father, forced onto a crowded and dirty train car, Lina, her mother, and her young brother slowly make their way north, crossing the Arctic Circle, to a work camp in the coldest reaches of Siberia. Here they are forced, under Stalin\u2019s orders, to dig for beets and fight for their lives under the cruelest of conditions.\nLina finds solace in her art, meticulously\u2013and at great risk\u2013documenting events by drawing, hoping these messages will make their way to her father\u2019s prison camp to let him know they are still alive. It is a long and harrowing journey, spanning years and covering 6,500 miles, but it is through incredible strength, love, and hope that Lina ultimately survives.Between Shades of Gray is a novel that will steal your breath and capture your heart.\n\nBetween Shades of Gray\u00a0explores some lesser known parts of WWII history. I actually did learn about the kolkhoz and gulags that Stalin set up in the USSR during what is now know as his \u2018Reign of Terror\u2019, and I\u2019m so glad that someone\u00a0has written a book about the horrors that occured during that period.\u00a0You can tell just from reading that this book is well-researched, as all the descriptions and historical details are accurate.\nAnyway, while I appreciate\u00a0the historical context the book explores, the plot and writing itself was brilliant. Sepetys\u2019 writing is quite simple, yet it is very effective in describing the horrors that occur to Lina and the rest of her family.\n\u201cHave you ever wondered what a human life is worth? That morning, my brother\u2019s was worth a pocket watch.\u201d\nNothing in this book sugarcoated, and so it is quite a grim story that really lets you appreciate how fortunate we really are. It places everything you thought was bad about the world we live in, like waking\u00a0up to birds screeching every\u00a0morning, into perspective.\nLina, our main character is brave despite the predicament she is in. I did find her to be\u00a0quite whiny, and also slightly\u00a0hypocritical at times. However, I appreciate that she is an artist, and that she\u00a0utilises\u00a0her art to share her experiences with the world, despite the risks and consequences. Although Lina was a strong character, both her mother and Lina\u2019s brother, Jonas were outstanding: they\u00a0are both extremely selfless and are extremely willing to do anything to help others.\nThere is also a\u00a0hint of\u00a0romance that takes place. While it is heartwarming, and also lightens the mood, I found it a little unnecessary. It did help with character development, but it didn\u2019t really move the plot anywhere.\nThe book alternates between Lina in the present, serving in the slavery camps and Lina of the past, in her suburban family life. I really like how there are certain prompts that juxtapose the situation she is forced to face as it helps accentuate the cruelty of the world she\u00a0lives in.\nOverall, I thought it was a brilliant book\u00a0with great writing addressing aspects of lesser-known history. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for historical fiction to read or if you\u2019re just looking for something that will break your heart.\nRating:\u00a0\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6 .5  ", "link": "https://kaleidoscopeofbooks.wordpress.com/2015/12/12/review-between-shades-of-gray-by-ruta-sepetys/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "that you can get for\u00a0$29.95 + shipping.

The type of sidebar that is filled with tons of funny gadgets, buttons, awards and God knows what? I'm sure you have! But in the midst of all this visual turmoil it is hard to find out what the blog is really about and who the blogger is behind it. Does this even sound like I'm describing YOUR sidebar? Then it is about time for some action!THE REASON FOR HAVING A SIDEBARHave you ever asked yourself why almost all blogs have a sidebar? Well, a sidebar is a great tool to focus on little snippets of information that serve both your readers as well as yourself.From the perspective of a reader a sidebar should hold some short information on the blog and the blogger, because, let's face it, we are curious beings and want to know more about the person behind the blog. This can be done by adding your image to the sidebar with a little blurb of information beneath it in the form of a welcome text or some personal info about yourself and the blog.Readers will also like the option to subscribe to your blog and to find some social icons through which they can connect to you. A subscription option and social icons do not have to be in the sidebar but should definitely be visible and easy to find on the front page (either on top of the page or at the footer).And last but not least, readers like a search bar. This tool will give readers the option to easily search for a certain kind of topic within your blog. From the perspective of the blogger the sidebar should hold the option to subscribe (or anywhere else on the front page that is very visible). Most bloggers like to grow their blogs, so a clearly visible subscription bar is a must! And so are social icons! They will give you the opportunity to grow your following on your social media platforms.If you are earning money through affiliate links or advertisements or you want to start doing this, you have to reserve a good spot in your sidebar for these ads and links. After all, they will bring money in!So the stuff you put in your sidebar should always serve both the reader and you!WHICH GADGETS ARE A MUST IN THE SIDEBAR?There are a ton of gadgets out there for sidebars, but we really don't need them all. There are some gadgets though that every sidebar should have. So let's explore them!Welcome ImageI personally always like it when there is an image of the blogger in the sidebar. It immediately gives an impression of who you are dealing with and it satisfies our curious nature. If you are a little bit shy and not comfortable with displaying a personal photo in your sidebar, then at least put a photo of yourself on your About page. People really like to know whom they're dealing with!Welcome Text/Personal IntroUnderneath or above your image should be a few lines that function as an intro. Welcome your readers, tell them what the blog is basically about and what to expect. Keep it short and write it in your own words. Further details, info and other interesting facts about the blog and you can be included on the About page or another informative page.Subscription OptionIf you don't offer a clearly visible subscription option, then how will you ever grow your blog? So add a subscription option to the sidebar. And if readers can subscribe through multiple platforms (Feedburner, Bloglovin etc.) add those as well!Search BarPeople are lazy and busy. Keep that in mind! They want you to provide them with every tool that helps them navigate your blog easily. Don't expect them to scroll through a hundred posts to find a post on a certain subject because they won't. So make it easy for them to find things. And a search bar is a tool that will help them find posts based on a keyword they can type in.WHICH GADGETS ARE A MAYBE IN THE SIDEBAR?Next to the gadgets mentioned in the paragraph before there are some other gadgets that can serve as a good tool for readers and yourself. So let's explore them.Popular Post GadgetThis gadget is one that I like very much myself. It will display a number of post titles that are read the most often by your readers. The links to the posts are often accompanied by a little thumbnail image and a snippet of text from the blog post. Having this gadget up in the sidebar gives your readers the option to find interesting articles very easy. They only have to click on the link. This gadget will probably keep your readers on your blog a little longer, reading more content, and that's a good thing!Blog ArchiveWhile not really necessary, the blog archive can act as a good search tool as well for your readers. If you take a look at mine in the sidebar of this website you will notice that I display it in such a way that the post titles of the current month are visible. This might be a trigger for readers to click through to the article.Labels / Categories GadgetAs you can see, I have a categ", "link": "http://www.thedutchladydesigns.com/2015/11/how-to-make-your-blog-sidebar-work-for-you.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 1, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Blogger Opp ~ Ozeri Ultra 42 inch Wind Fan Giveaway!

My mother and my music.\nMama was taken from me too soon, and now music is all I have left. It\u2019s the thing that\u2019s pushed me right out of backwoods Georgia into Los Angeles, where the line between fantasy and reality shimmers and blurs. I\u2019m finally making my way, making my mark. I can\u2019t afford to fall for one of music's brightest stars. Not now. Music is all I have left, and I\u2019m holding on tight with both hands. I won\u2019t let go, not even for Rhyson Gray.\nRHYSON\nI had one thing in my life that mattered \u2013 music. The only constant, it\u2019s taken me to heights most people only dream about; a gift dropped in my lap at birth. I thought it was enough. I thought it was everything until I met Kai. Now she\u2019s all I think about, like a song I can't get out of my head. If I have to chase her, if I have to give up everything - I will. And once she's mine, I won't let go.\n\nGoodreads\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25905605-my-soul-to-keep?ac=1\n\n*****5 #NEEDNEXTBOOKNOW STARS*****\nhttps://www.amazon.com/review/R2S8Y5XXUXFMT/ref=pe_1098610_137716200_cm_rv_eml_rv0_rv \n\nExcerpt\nI shouldn\u2019t have come. All the things I felt and fought, the things I suspected he felt too, he just spewed all over me. And as much as I want to be, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ll never forget seeing my Mama in bed for days after Daddy left. And even though she got up, I suspect a part of her never left that bed, but just stayed there, waiting. We had to leave the house where she grew up and where I spent my first years, because Daddy left us with nowhere to go. Mama learned to stand on her two feet, and I\u2019ve done the same. I just didn\u2019t count on Rhyson sweeping me off of them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously on different pages about this.\u201d I pull my hands free and turn to leave, but he steps in front of me, blocking my grand exit. \u201cLet\u2019s talk later.\u201d\n\u201cEnough talking.\u201d\nThe heat of his body grabs me before his hands do. He traps my chin between two fingers, taking my mouth in a paradox of rough and tender. I want to move. To slide away from his body pressing me into the pool table. But I can\u2019t. Not with his hand caressing my back. Not with his tongue in my mouth. Not with his erection pressing into my stomach. I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t. I have been denying myself this, and I\u2019m so damn hungry. My mouth opens under his, ravenous and wet and hot. His groan vibrates against my lips.\n\u201cYes. Good God, yes, Pep.\u201d His words slip down my throat.\nI strain up on tiptoes, clawing my fingers into his dark hair, forcing him closer. He lifts me onto the pool table, planting himself between my knees. His fingers skim my bare thigh, working up my leg until he reaches a damp patch of silk. He pushes my panties aside, rubbing his hand into the wet flesh there before sliding one long finger and then another inside of me. I rock into these fingers which have awed millions with their skill. They own me. I\u2019m the instrument in his hands. He\u2019s playing me. Plucking at me. Strumming me.\nHe tugs at the wide neck of my sweater until it falls away from my shoulder, slipping his hand in and cupping my naked breast. He brushes his fingers over my nipple, and I lose my mind and every inhibition. My head flops back and I stretch my legs wider, offering him anything he wants.\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d His question burns the vulnerable curve of my neck as he drags his lips to my shoulder. \u201cYou come here wearing no bra and think I won\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nHe abandons the words, his dark, untidy head disappearing under my sweater, and before I have time to regain even millimeters of sanity, my nipple is in his mouth and he\u2019s suckling me. Not gentle. Not soft. My breasts are so small, he almost eats me whole. Every draw, every suck, every bite sends a power surge to my core until my knees hold his hips in a desperate grip, and my nails rake across the flat surface of the pool table behind me.\nHis mouth at my breast. His fingers inside me. His clean scent surrounding me. I have nowhere to hide anymore. I am exposed. I want to spread myself wide open for him. That voice that has been telling me I can\u2019t rely on him. I can\u2019t trust him. I can\u2019t need him\u2014that voice is stunned into silence by his thorough possession of my body, by the inferno between my legs, blazing a hole right through my soul and scorching my heart.\n\nBuy Links\n\nGiveaway\na Rafflecopter giveaway\nDirect Link:\nhttp://www.rafflecopter.com/rafl/display/0cba4250182/\n\nHTML:\n<a class=\"rcptr\" href=\"http://www.rafflecopter.com/rafl/display/0cba4250182/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-raflid=\"0cba4250182\" data-theme=\"classic\" data-template=\"\" id=\"rcwidget_nq8tc636\">a Rafflecopter giveaway</a>\n<script src=\"//widget-prime.rafflecopter.com/launch.js\"></script>\n\nPlaylist\n          HTML:\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A12129721428%3Aplaylist%3A6PL0cDX9qlB672TpP5OaVb\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" framebo", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/580383222060642/posts/868751526557142", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "#MISNICISM #NWO_OPS #SD_ECBS_NEWSFEED\nOPEN ALL STUDY ALL EVEN INTRO\nROOSEVELT CREATOR OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER\nhttp://www.supporters-desk.com/index.php?option=com_agora&task=topic&id=250&Itemid=30#p3662\nMUST SEE CHRIS EVERARD ABOUT THE NWO-STRUCTURES BEHIND\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-HnxbkdoC0\nStudy the comment-feed of this SD_ECBS-data-container\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=430092823692309&set=a.360053300696262.91864.237775506257376&type=3&theater\nThis infotrack is presented by the SD_ECBS\nhttp://noalienbutuniversalnature.com/\nhttp://copyandpastewillhealtheworld.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/SD_ECBS/237775506257376\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Allda-Ben-Marius-de-Bruycker-sd_ecbs-CEO/267908053414757", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/237775506257376/posts/1064018566966395", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "THE GODS WANT US TO BE LIKE THEM!\nOpen intro into this post and study all\nWe live on a superrare full elements planet mother earth with a shining sun naturally to find in the inner galaxy daily hosted by \nour creators as documented by the SOHO 2010 DISCOVERIES!!!\nSo indication for full creation and all we have to do is stopping behave like complete idiots!\nIF NOT IT IS CLOSING TIME FOR HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS LIKE THEY DID WITH DINASAURS,\nHOMO CROMAGNON, ERECTUS AND NEANDERTHALENSIS.

My feet followed the sound, stepping absently closer to it, and I finally pressed my ear against the wall leading to my hallway, my heart racing as the vibrations touched my skin.Resting my cheek against the surface, I swallowed the tight lump in my throat as the thumping against the wall grew faster and faster.There was someone over there. In the empty apartment.Holding up my phone, I dialed the office downstairs but got no answer. I knew there was a night manager named Simon Something-Or-Other, but I didn\u2019t think many people were on duty at night. He must be away from his desk.I continued listening, wondering if I could ignore it and just wait until morning to ask the manager about it, but the further down the hall I travelled, the louder it got until I was standing next to the rear entrance.Opening up the door, I peeked my head into the hallway, holding the heavy steel exit open just enough to inspect.Glancing to my right, I saw a door just like mine. And then I heard a woman\u2019s high-pitched cry ring out around me, and I started breathing harder.And then there was another cry. And another, and another, and\u2026Was she having sex? My mouth fell open as I tried not to laugh.Oh, my God.But I thought the place was supposed to be empty.I stepped out, knife in hand\u2014just in case\u2014and walked quietly down to the other door, glancing up and seeing small security cameras along the wall, probably installed when the apartments were built.Pressing my ear to the door, I listened, still hearing the thump, thump, thump of something hitting the wall, and the girl\u2019s breathy cries over and over again.I folded my lips between my teeth, covering my smile with my free hand.But then the woman cried out. \u201cNo! Ah, oh, God! Please!\u201dAnd my face fell, hearing the fear in her voice. The short, shrill screams were now different. Panicked and scared, and her cries sounded struggled. My mouth suddenly went dry as I stood there listening.\u201cAh!\u201d she cried out again. \u201cNo, please stop!\u201dI backed away from the door, not finding it funny anymore.But then something hit the door from the other side, making a loud thud, and I scurried backward. \u201cOh, shit,\u201d I gritted out under my breath.I shot my head up to the cameras, now wondering if they fed to Security downstairs or to whoever was inside the apartment. Did they know I was out here?I spun around and dashed for my door, grabbing the handle and trying to twist it.But it was locked. \u201cDammit!\u201d I mouthed. Fucking thing must lock automatically.Another thud hit the door, mere feet away from me\u2014so close\u2014and I darted my eyes over to it, my breathing turning fast and painful.I pulled on the door handle again, twisting and yanking, but it didn\u2019t budge.Another thud hit the door, and I jerked upright, dropping the knife.\u201cShit.\u201dI dived down to pick it up, but just then I heard the other door swing open, so I bolted down the stairwell, hiding behind the wall and forgetting about the knife.Fuck!Screw this. Whoever was coming out of the vacant apartment was definitely someone I didn\u2019t want to meet. I dashed down flight after flight, a cry lodged in my throat as fear gripped my chest.A pounding echoed abo", "link": "http://www.corriethebookcrazedgirl.com/2015/12/blog-tour-corrupt-by-penelope-douglas.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Book Wars!

Lisa\u00a0This week we have the second in author Katie McGarry's Thunder Road series. And when you take a look at these two books they couldn't be more different from one another.And the more I look at the UK cover, the more it draws me in. I think it's the colors and tones that \"speak\" to me. However, the US cover looks so much more polished and the bridge and the colors of this one are really pretty amazing.It think I could get lost in the US cover, which is getting my vote for this week! Which one do you like best? Give us a quick click below and let us know.Michelle\u00a0I have seen both of these covers before, but not together. Looking at them side by side it's very easy for me to pick my favourite.The UK one looks nice, but to me it feels like it's been done before, that it's just another cover with a boy and girl leaning against a car. The US cover though I really like.I love the scenery in the background, how the cover model is walking away, it makes me want to know where is he walking to or from. I also love the font they used for the cover, I think it fits better with the theme of the series itself.Its a US win for me this week, don't forget to cast your vote below.VOTE for YOUR\u00a0favorite\u00a0cover of\u00a0Walk the Edge (Thunder Road #2)\u00a0NOW!

Things were torn away from me that I would never get back. Hearts were broken beyond repair. Then mayhem ensued, and I lost who I was. \nMusic was always part of it. Music almost killed me. It dragged me in, caught me up, and almost destroyed me. I lost who I was and became someone I never wanted to be. \nSex, drugs, and rock and roll. The release, the buzz, the electric guitar's rage against all that was f'ed up in the world. It took me away and made me feel something when I was a soulless nothing \u2026 until the high wore off. \nMusic also brought me back. \nI woke to a Zeppelin song, face down in my own vomit, next to a pile of coke and with three naked women at my feet. Disgusted with myself, disgusted with them, I walked, and I walked alone. \nOne chance meeting, a golden opportunity, a chance of a lifetime changed it all. \nThe sins of the past are behind me now. The day has finally come when I will walk onstage, not as an opening act, but as the act. Hours before my dream comes to fruition, though, I run into a girl, one f'ing girl, and I am back on the path of destruction.\n\n*****5 SEXY BASSIST STARS*****\nhttps://www.amazon.com/review/R1IWCHUIGZEO7B/ref=pe_1098610_137716200_cm_rv_eml_rv0_rv\n\nExcerpt\n\u201cI\u2019ve tasted better.\u201d His eyes lazily gaze down my body, causing me to squirm inside, but I hold it together.

My mother and my music.\nMama was taken from me too soon, and now music is all I have left. It\u2019s the thing that\u2019s pushed me right out of backwoods Georgia into Los Angeles, where the line between fantasy and\nreality shimmers and blurs. I\u2019m finally making my way, making my mark. I can\u2019t afford to fall for one of music\u2019s brightest stars. Not now. Music is all I have left, and I\u2019m holding\non tight with both hands.

The only constant, it\u2019s taken me to heights most people only dream about; a gift dropped in my lap at birth. I thought it was enough. I\nthought it was everything until I met Kai. Now she\u2019s all I think about, like a song I can\u2019t get out of my head. If I have to chase her, if I have to give up everything - I will. And once she\u2019s\nmine, I won\u2019t let go.\nGoodreads\n\u00a0\nMy Goodreads Review for MY Soul to Keep\n\u00a0\nExcerpt\n\u00a0\nI shouldn\u2019t have come. All the things I felt and fought, the things I suspected he felt too, he just spewed all over me. And as much as I want to be, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready.\nI\u2019ll never forget seeing my Mama in bed for days after Daddy left. And even though she got up, I suspect a part of her never left that bed, but just stayed there, waiting. We had to leave the\nhouse where she grew up and where I spent my first years, because Daddy left us with nowhere to go. Mama learned to stand on her two feet, and I\u2019ve done the same. I just didn\u2019t count on\nRhyson sweeping me off of them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously on different pages about this.\u201d I pull my hands free and turn to leave, but he steps in front of me, blocking my grand exit. \u201cLet\u2019s talk later.\u201d\n\u201cEnough talking.\u201d\nThe heat of his body grabs me before his hands do. He traps my chin between two fingers, taking my mouth in a paradox of rough and tender. I want to move. To slide away from his body pressing me into\nthe pool table. But I can\u2019t. Not with his hand caressing my back. Not with his tongue in my mouth. Not with his erection pressing into my stomach. I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t. I have been\ndenying myself this, and I\u2019m so damn hungry. My mouth opens under his, ravenous and wet and hot. His groan vibrates against my lips.\n\u201cYes. Good God, yes, Pep.\u201d His words slip down my throat.\nI strain up on tiptoes, clawing my fingers into his dark hair, forcing him closer. He lifts me onto the pool table, planting himself between my knees. His fingers skim my bare thigh, working up my leg\nuntil he reaches a damp patch of silk. He pushes my panties aside, rubbing his hand into the wet flesh there before sliding one long finger and then another inside of me. I rock into these fingers\nwhich have awed millions with their skill. They own me. I\u2019m the instrument in his hands. He\u2019s playing me. Plucking at me. Strumming me.\nHe tugs at the wide neck of my sweater until it falls away from my shoulder, slipping his hand in and cupping my naked breast. He brushes his fingers over my nipple, and I lose my mind and every\ninhibition. My head flops back and I stretch my legs wider, offering him anything he wants.\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d His question burns the vulnerable curve of my neck as he drags his lips to my shoulder. \u201cYou come here wearing no bra and think I won\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nHe abandons the words, his dark, untidy head disappearing under my sweater, and before I have time to regain even millimeters of sanity, my nipple is in his mouth and he\u2019s suckling me. Not\ngentle. Not soft. My breasts are so small, he almost eats me whole. Every draw, every suck, every bite sends a power surge to my core until my knees hold his hips in a desperate grip, and my nails\nrake across the flat surface of the pool table behind me.\nHis mouth at my breast. His fingers inside me. His clean scent surrounding me. I have nowhere to hide anymore. I am exposed. I want to spread myself wide open for him. That voice that has been telling\nme I can\u2019t rely on him. I can\u2019t trust him. I can\u2019t need him\u2014that voice is stunned into silence by his thorough possession of my body, by the inferno between my legs, blazing\na hole right through my soul and scorching my heart.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nBuy Links\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGiveaway\n\u00a0\na Rafflecopter giveaway\n\u00a0\nPlaylist\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAbout Kennedy Ryan\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI just can\u2019t write about myself in third person for one more bio!

All she had to do was lean forward, and their lips would meet. \u201cWhatever. Sounds great.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He smiled at her, a glint in his eyes. \u201cI knew you\u2019d choose open water.\u201d He indicated her tote bag. \u201cTake only what you need. Your stuff will be safe here.\u201d He slid the sunglasses on and returned to his side of the truck.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Abby shook her head to clear the sexual fog before opening her door and stepping out of the truck. Boats of all sizes, from little motor boats to sailboats and yachts, bobbed in the crystal blue waters just beyond the boardwalk. White gulls perched on pilings like mini bird statues, and the floating docks below creaked in time to the rhythm of the rolling waves. Her shoulders relaxed as she sucked in the ocean air. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dylan joined her. \u201cNo matter how long I live here, I\u2019ll never be immune to the island\u2019s beauty.\u201d He took her hand. \u201cC\u2019mon. It\u2019s over here.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They strolled onto the boardwalk, past shops, around a corner along the water\u2019s edge where mouthwatering aromas of surf and turf spilled from seaside restaurants and tourists posed for photos or headed for fun on the water like them. She stopped to snap a photo for a happy couple on their honeymoon while Dylan walked ahead of her around another bend.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The couple thanked her, and she turned to catch up with Dylan. She was just about there when she heard him call out to someone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHey, Kyle.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had this all been some elaborate trap? Abby clapped a hand over her mouth and ducked between two tour booths next to the boardwalk before peeking out. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dylan greeted a short, dark-haired guy with a pat on the shoulder. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She scanned the boardwalk. It was empty aside from the two men.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She released a breath and stepped back onto the boardwalk. Heat rose to her cheeks, and she smoothed her hair before continuing toward them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The shorter man glanced at Abby as she approached and turned to Dylan with a grin. \u201cNow I understand why I haven\u2019t seen you the past couple weeks.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dylan shrugged, not bothering to correct him. \u201cThis is my friend, Abby.\u201d He took her hand in his. \u201cAbby, this is my buddy, Kyle.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFriend, huh?\u201d Kyle glanced at their clasped hands. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you hold hands with any woman before, man. I think there\u2019s way more going on here than friendliness.\u201d He chuckled. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dylan ignored the guy\u2019s good-natured ribbing. \u201cSo, where are those wave runners we talked about?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kyle smirked. \u201cWell, I was worried you\u2019d be upset, man, \u2018cause right after you called I found out the last two single riders were booked, but lucky for you, I\u2019ve got a two-rider available.\u201d He winked at Dylan and shot Abby a smile.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dylan turned to her. \u201cStill want to go? You can drive.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She pictured herself snuggled against his back, the wind in their hair and sun on their faces as they floated around the lush, green island. She nodded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you drive first and then I\u2019ll take a turn once I get the hang of it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kyle grabbed a clipboard from a nearby booth. \u201cSounds like a plan, man. Just sign here, and the baby\u2019s yours for the afternoon.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They signed the waivers stating the wave runner company wasn\u2019t responsible for potential loss of life and limb. Maybe she should have brought that ace bandage for its intended purpose. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dylan nudged her shoulder. \u201c", "link": "http://bookschatter.blogspot.com/2015/12/tour-one-more-sunset.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Here\u2019s your chance to be able to do laser treatments at home thanks to Skin Ceuticals!

Leaving a sold-out show in Phoenix, he rents a car and drives north and east, landing in the Painted Desert town of Rainbow Rock.Nearly three years after leaving her old life behind, Lottie Beale is feeding people and baking pies, managing the Kachina Caf\u00e9 and tending secrets of her own. When circumstances conspire to give two attractive people some time alone together amid the world-class vistas of the Four Corners, they discover more than either had bargained for.Amazon\u00a0|\u00a0Barnes and NobleExcerpt\u201cRo-man! Ro-man!\u201d A capacity crowd in the Ak-Chin Pavilion chanted his name under the starry desert sky, but Roman Kincaid barely heard it. He stood in the stage wings, gearing up for an encore and wondering when his dream had become a nightmare.\u201cOkay, guys,\u201d he said to his back-up band via their ear buds. \u201cOne encore only. Let\u2019s do \u2018Gamble.\u2019 Start with the chorus.\u201d He took two steps toward the stage entrance, swinging his guitar into playing position.Sam, his manager, caught his elbow. \u201cAre you sure about this? That crowd adores you. You could probably play three encores, sell more CDs\u2014\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Roman left no room for argument. \u201cOne and done. And no backstage stuff, either. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d He took a deep breath, pasted on the same fake, crowd-pleasing smile he\u2019d used in the last half-dozen shows, and jogged back onto the stage to the roar of twenty thousand excited voices. He strummed the intro and launched into the chorus of his first number-one hit:\u201cLove is such a gamble.You break a new deck every time.Sometimes you\u2019re dealt the aces;Others you draw to nines.But when I met you, I knew it was true.A winning hand you seemed.Now I have the rush of a royal flush.You are the gamble of my dreams.\u201dThe crowd cheered wildly as he played his way through the music he now sang in his sleep. In fact, he realized as he watched fans taking up the beat and clapping along, that was pretty much what he was doing now. He struggled to suppress a yawn during the guitar interlude as he turned to acknowledge his band.I spent my early life dreaming of a crowd like this. When did performing start to feel like a chore? He put the thought away. Lately he\u2019d been thinking of times when he\u2019d heard of some celebrity being hospitalized for exhaustion and assumed it was a euphemism for drug rehab. Now he wondered. When was the last time I felt truly rested? The question was an imponderable. Months, at least.He hit the last chord and took a deep bow, then shouted, \u201cThank you, Phoenix!\u201d and dashed off-stage.About the authorSusan Aylworth started her first book when she was nine. \"It was called Buff, The Proud Stallion. I wrote eight whole pages.\" For her fifth grade career day, she stated her ambition to become \"a rich and famous author.\" Decades later, she is pleased to have achieved the 'author' part of that goal.

My mother and my music. Mama was taken from me too soon, and now music is all I have left. It\u2019s the thing that\u2019s pushed me right out of backwoods Georgia into Los Angeles, where the line between fantasy and reality shimmers and blurs. I\u2019m finally making my way, making my mark. I can\u2019t afford to fall for one of music's brightest stars. Not now. Music is all I have left, and I\u2019m holding on tight with both hands.

The only constant, it\u2019s  taken me to heights most people only dream about; a gift dropped in my lap at birth. I thought it was enough. I thought it was everything until I met Kai. Now she\u2019s all I think about, like a song I can't get out of my head. If I have to chase her, if I have to give up everything - I will. And once she's mine, I won't let go.Add It To Your Goodreads\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0  I shouldn\u2019t have come. All the things I felt and fought, the things I suspected he felt too, he just spewed all over me. And as much as I want to be, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ll never forget seeing my Mama in bed for days after Daddy left. And even though she got up, I suspect a part of her never left that bed, but just stayed there, waiting. We had to leave the house where she grew up and where I spent my first years, because Daddy left us with nowhere to go. Mama learned to stand on her two feet, and I\u2019ve done the same. I just didn\u2019t count on Rhyson sweeping me off of them.  \u201cWe\u2019re obviously on different pages about this.\u201d I pull my hands free and turn to leave, but he steps in front of me, blocking my grand exit. \u201cLet\u2019s talk later.\u201d  \u201cEnough talking.\u201d  The heat of his body grabs me before his hands do.

Not gentle. Not soft. My breasts are so small, he almost eats me whole. Every draw, every suck, every bite sends a power surge to my core until my knees hold his hips in a desperate grip, and my nails rake across the flat surface of the pool table behind me.  His mouth at my breast. His fingers inside me. His clean scent surrounding me. I have nowhere to hide anymore. I am exposed. I want to spread myself wide open for him.

My mother and my music.\nMama was taken from me too soon, and now music is all I have left. It\u2019s the thing that\u2019s pushed me right out of backwoods Georgia into Los Angeles, where the line between fantasy and reality shimmers and blurs. I\u2019m finally making my way, making my mark. I can\u2019t afford to fall for one of music\u2019s brightest stars. Not now. Music is all I have left, and I\u2019m holding on tight with both hands. I won\u2019t let go, not even for Rhyson Gray.\nRHYSON\nI had one thing in my life that mattered \u2013 music. The only constant, it\u2019s taken me to heights most people only dream about; a gift dropped in my lap at birth. I thought it was enough. I thought it was everything until I met Kai. Now she\u2019s all I think about, like a song I can\u2019t get out of my head. If I have to chase her, if I have to give up everything \u2013 I will.

I\u2019ll never forget seeing my Mama in bed for days after Daddy left. And even though she got up, I suspect a part of her never left that bed, but just stayed there, waiting. We had to leave the house where she grew up and where I spent my first years, because Daddy left us with nowhere to go. Mama learned to stand on her two feet, and I\u2019ve done the same.

Tucker Ten Tiny Breaths by K.A. Tucker\nMy rating: 3 of 5 stars\nReceived: Bought\nPublication Date: December 11th 2012\nPublisher: Papoti Books\nPoint of View: 1st Person & Feminine\nRecommended Age: 14+\nGenres & Themes: New Adult, Contemporary Romance, Death\nBLURB:\nKacey Cleary\u2019s whole life imploded four years ago in a drunk-driving accident. Now she\u2019s working hard to bury the pieces left behind\u2014all but one. Her little sister, Livie. Kacey can swallow the constant disapproval from her born-again aunt Darla over her self-destructive lifestyle; she can stop herself from going kick-boxer crazy on Uncle Raymond when he loses the girls\u2019 college funds at a blackjack table. She just needs to keep it together until Livie is no longer a minor, and then they can get the hell out of Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nBut when Uncle Raymond slides into bed next to Livie one night, Kacey decides it\u2019s time to run. Armed with two bus tickets and dreams of living near the coast, Kacey and Livie start their new lives in a Miami apartment complex, complete with a grumpy landlord, a pervert upstairs, and a neighbor with a stage name perfectly matched to her chosen \u201cprofession.\u201d But Kacey\u2019s not worried. She can handle all of them. What she can\u2019t handle is Trent Emerson in apartment 1D.\nKacey doesn\u2019t want to feel. She doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s safer that way. For everyone. But sexy Trent finds a way into her numb heart, reigniting her ability to love again. She starts to believe that maybe she can leave the past where it belongs and start over. Maybe she\u2019s not beyond repair.\nBut Kacey isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s broken. Seemingly perfect Trent has an unforgiveable past of his own; one that, when discovered, will shatter Kacey\u2019s newly constructed life and send her back into suffocating darkness.\nREVIEW:\nThis has been a long month. In truth, I will admit to having finished two novels\u2026 including this one. This has never happened before, and I hope it will never happen again. I was about to finish a third book, but Jurassic Park\u2019s last hundred pages just don\u2019t make me feel as excited as the previous ones.\nAnyway, enough blabbering. Ten Tiny Breaths has been on my \u2018\u2018New Adult to Read before I Die\u2019\u2019 list for a year before I saw it on sale on Bookoutlet.ca and thought, \u2018\u2018meh, why not?\u2019\u2019 It was worth the couple of bucks I paid for it, but it really made me realize that I should attempt fixing this bad habit I have to never read the synopsises of books! I think I\u2019m about to read a love/hate romance story when what I get is a mystery book. I think I\u2019m about to lose myself in a psychological thriller when what I get is a cheesy college romance story.\nHere I go again. All this to say that I had not clue this book would deal with death, lost, forgiveness and contain (clearly) a lot of psychological elements. I mean, I definitely predicted something relatively intense, but the overdone car accident leads to parents\u2019 death, leads to emotional breakdown, leads to moving away, leads to meeting a hot guy that will save the day just didn\u2019t take me by surprise.\nI appreciated all the background we got on Kacey, because it really helps us understand her motives better and opens our comprehensive eyes to a lot of the things she does (or did) that we normally wouldn\u2019t approve of. Kacey is a character that is not easily defined, especially not by the place where she lives or works but it\u2019s the why she lives in a crappy place and works in a strip club that are worth analysing.\nKacey is physically strong, that can easily be said, but she\u2019s also very stubborn and emotionally fragile. She may deny that if someone ever dares say that to her face but, believe me, she\u2019s got this wall she built to keep everyone out, because she\u2019s afraid that, if it crumbles, she will too. I liked her. I didn\u2019t connect to her, because broken heroes and heroines are very hit or miss for me, but I dare say I wouldn\u2019t mind reading another book with her in it.\nAs for *trumpets* Trent, the hot and mysterious guy with gorgeous blue eyes from the laundry room, I\u2019m going to say that I\u2019m not displeased. Of course, I predicted the plot twist, so that\u2019s always a down, but I didn\u2019t mind him\u2026 Thing is, he\u2019s pretty much like every other New Adult broken hero I\u2019ve encountered before, except for the fact that he carries a little less of a heavy pack of anger, self-pity and self-destruction with him. Thank god.\nLivie, Storm and Mia were my sunshine in this book. I love how present they are and how their presence in the story has an actual purpose\u2026 and the fact that they get their own moment to share their story in the companion novels. I guess this is why the author doesn\u2019t reveal too much about their background, although she does satisfy the reader\u2019s curiosity.\nIn sum, Ten Tiny Breaths, while enjoyable, is not that different from the majority of New Adult books there already are out there, but, hell, it\u2019s a structure that works and sells and that I personally keep re", "link": "https://hitormissbooks.wordpress.com/2015/11/19/review-ten-tiny-breaths-ten-tiny-breaths-1-by-k-a-tucker/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "get an over-the-counter product like:\nL\u2019Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle +Firming Night Cream, $18\nRoC Retinol Correxion Sensitive Night Cream, $18\nSkinCeuticals Retinol 1.0 Refining Night Cream, $63\nIf you\u2019re looking for instant results, this next statement will conflict with my previous", "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FirstClassFashionista/~3/LqwAys6h2f4/67357", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Roman\u2019s Holiday $50 Book Blast Giveaway! \u00a0\n\nRoman\u2019s Holiday by Susan Aylworth\n\nFour years after Roman Kincaid was catapulted into stardom as a country-western singer and A-list movie star, he is burned out: exhausted by a grueling schedule, drained by the ceaseless demands of producers and managers, weary of meeting the needs of others at the expense of his own.

Ro-man!\u201d A capacity crowd in the Ak-Chin Pavilion chanted his name under the starry desert sky, but Roman Kincaid barely heard it. He stood in the stage wings, gearing up for an encore and wondering when his dream had become a nightmare.\n\u201cOkay, guys,\u201d he said to his back-up band via their ear buds. \u201cOne encore only. Let\u2019s do \u2018Gamble.\u2019 Start with the chorus.\u201d He took two steps toward the stage entrance, swinging his guitar into playing position.\nSam, his manager, caught his elbow. \u201cAre you sure about this? That crowd adores you. You could probably play three encores, sell more CDs\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Roman left no room for argument. \u201cOne and done. And no backstage stuff, either. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d He took a deep breath, pasted on the same fake, crowd-pleasing smile he\u2019d used in the last half-dozen shows, and jogged back onto the stage to the roar of twenty thousand excited voices. He strummed the intro and launched into the chorus of his first number-one hit:\n\u201cLove is such a gamble.\nYou break a new deck every time.\nSometimes you\u2019re dealt the aces;\nOthers you draw to nines.\nBut when I met you, I knew it was true.\nA winning hand you seemed.\nNow I have the rush of a royal flush.\nYou are the gamble of my dreams.\u201d\nThe crowd cheered wildly as he played his way through the music he now sang in his sleep. In fact, he realized as he watched fans taking up the beat and clapping along, that was pretty much what he was doing now. He struggled to suppress a yawn during the guitar interlude as he turned to acknowledge his band.\nI spent my early life dreaming of a crowd like this. When did performing start to feel like a chore? He put the thought away. Lately he\u2019d been thinking of times when he\u2019d heard of some celebrity being hospitalized for exhaustion and assumed it was a euphemism for drug rehab. Now he wondered. When was the last time I felt truly rested? The question was an imponderable. Months, at least.\nHe hit the last chord and took a deep bow, then shouted, \u201cThank you, Phoenix!\u201d and dashed off-stage.\n\n\u00a0\nAuthor Susan Aylworth\n\n\nSusan Aylworth started her first book when she was nine. \u201cIt was called Buff, The Proud Stallion. I wrote eight whole pages.\u201d For her fifth grade career day, she stated her ambition to become \u201ca rich and famous author.\u201d Decades later, she is pleased to have achieved the \u2018author\u2019 part of that goal. A former university professor, she enjoys researching backgrounds and careers for her novels. \u201cIt\u2019s one way to live many lives at once.\u201d She lives in northern California with her husband of 45 years and two spoiled cats.\n\nWebsite * Facebook * Twitter * Blog\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nBook Blast Giveaway \u2013 $50 Amazon Gift Card or $50 in Paypal Cash\nEnds 12/11/15\nOpen only to those who can legally enter, receive and use an Amazon.com Gift Code or Paypal Cash.

My feet followed the sound, stepping absently closer to it, and I finally pressed my ear against the wall leading to my hallway, my heart racing as the vibrations touched my skin.\nResting my cheek against the surface, I swallowed the tight lump in my throat as the thumping against the wall grew faster and faster.\nThere was someone over there. In the empty apartment.\nHolding up my phone, I dialed the office downstairs but got no answer. I knew there was a night manager named Simon Something-Or-Other, but I didn\u2019t think many people were on duty at night. He must be away from his desk.\nI continued listening, wondering if I could ignore it and just wait until morning to ask the manager about it, but the further down the hall I travelled, the louder it got until I was standing next to the rear entrance.\nOpening up the door, I peeked my head into the hallway, holding the heavy steel exit open just enough to inspect.\nGlancing to my right, I saw a door just like mine. And then I heard a woman\u2019s high-pitched cry ring out around me, and I started breathing harder.\nAnd then there was another cry. And another, and another, and\u2026\nWas she having sex? My mouth fell open as I tried not to laugh.\nOh, my God.\nBut I thought the place was supposed to be empty.\nI stepped out, knife in hand\u2014just in case\u2014and walked quietly down to the other door, glancing up and seeing small security cameras along the wall, probably installed when the apartments were built.\nPressing my ear to the door, I listened, still hearing the thump, thump, thump of something hitting the wall, and the girl\u2019s breathy cries over and over again.\nI folded my lips between my teeth, covering my smile with my free hand.\nBut then the woman cried out. \u201cNo! Ah, oh, God! Please!\u201d\nAnd my face fell, hearing the fear in her voice. The short, shrill screams were now different. Panicked and scared, and her cries sounded struggled. My mouth suddenly went dry as I stood there listening.\n\u201cAh!\u201d she cried out again. \u201cNo, please stop!\u201d\nI backed away from the door, not finding it funny anymore.\nBut then something hit the door from the other side, making a loud thud, and I scurried backward. \u201cOh, shit,\u201d I gritted out under my breath.\nI shot my head up to the cameras, now wondering if they fed to Security downstairs or to whoever was inside the apartment. Did they know I was out here?\nI spun around and dashed for my door, grabbing the handle and trying to twist it.\nBut it was locked. \u201cDammit!\u201d I mouthed. Fucking thing must lock automatically.\nAnother thud hit the door, mere feet away from me\u2014so close\u2014and I darted my eyes over to it, my breathing turning fast and painful.\nI pulled on the door handle again, twisting and yanking, but it didn\u2019t budge.\nAnother thud hit the door, and I jerked upright, dropping the knife.\n\u201cShit.\u201d\nI dived down to pick it up, but just then I heard the other door swing open, so I bolted down the stairwell, hiding behind the wall and forgetting about the knife.\nFuck!\nScrew this.

Starting with the fact that I couldn\u2019t stop reading it from chapter 1. People laugh at my reactions while reading it because there were moments when I didn\u2019t wanted it to stop and moments when I wanted to have the book 100ft away from me. It was an emotional ride, I enjoyed every word.\nI connected with the characters right away. CoHo writes in a way that makes the characters feel real. The story is told present and past. Tate is narrating the present and Miles gives us his story years before. Both character\u2019s POV complement each other creating intrigue and suspense.\nUgly Love is a very sexy book. When I say sexy I\u2019m talking about all the sex scenes it has, and Miles\u2026.obviously Miles.\u00a0The sex scenes didn\u2019t bothered me at all. They are part of the\u00a0development of the story. It\u2019s not just there to fill the pages and make girls squeal, they are very important for the story.\nUgly Love it\u2019s a love story about moving on, letting go of the past and giving a second chance to love.\nThe ending is beautiful. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be over it. It was beyond perfect.\nOverall review: If Ugly Love was a person, I would have all its babies.

The doors opened as soon as I pushed the button, and I stepped inside, trying to calm my racing heart.They still intimidated me.And excited me. And challenged me. And knotted me up.I\u2019d kind of wanted to go to a party but not with them.The doors started closing, but just then a hand shot into the elevator, and I jumped, seeing the doors re-open. I sucked in a breath, staring wide-eyed as Michael reached in, grabbed my shirt by the collar with one hand, and pulled me out.\u201cMichael!\u201d I shouted.I stumbled into him, and before I knew what was happening, he grabbed my wrists and locked them behind my back, walking into me and forcing me backward, back down the hall toward the kitchen.\u201cLet me go!\u201d I demanded, my lips brushing the tip of his chin.\u201cI don\u2019t know, guys,\u201d he teased over my head, \u201cshe still seems pretty fucking easy to push around. What do you think?\u201dLaughter greeted me as he forced me back into the living area.Every muscle in my body was on fire, and the tips of my toes kept getting caught under his sneakers.I twisted my body, trying to break his hold. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201dI pushed against his chest and jerked my body to the left, tearing out of his hold with every muscle I could muster.I stumbled, losing my balance, and fell backward, crashing to the floor. Pain shot through my ass, running down my legs as the fall knocked the wind out me.Shit!Shooting my hands behind me, I pushed myself up and bent my knees, looking up at him as he advanced.He stalked over and then stopped, towering over me. I immediately moved my hands and feet, crawling backward, away from him.But then I felt something at my back, and I halted. I twisted my head, seeing a dark pant leg, and I didn\u2019t know if it was Damon, Will, or Kai, but it didn\u2019t matter. I was closed in.Oh, no. I slowly raised my eyes, seeing Michael\u2019s lips tilt in a devious smile. I stopped breathing, seeing him lower his body to the floor, planting his knees between my bent legs, and his hands at my sides.My neck arched back as his face hovered over mine, but I tried to keep myself up as much as possible, no matter how close his body got.\u201cI thought you were one of us,\u201d his whispered, his breath caressing my lips. \u201cI thought you could play.\u201dI stilled, staring into his eyes.You\u2019re one of us now. Will had said that to me on that night so long ago.Michael\u2019s amber eyes searched mine and then dropped to my mouth, his breathing growing heavy as he stared at me like he was about to take a bite.I wanted to cry. What the hell was going on?Three years ago was nearly the happiest night of my life, and it quickly became the worst. And ever since then, Michael not only acted as if I didn\u2019t exist, but also, at times, as if he wished I didn\u2019t.Now the guys were free, and they were all back together again. What did I have to do with any of this? What did he want with me?\u201cI don\u2019t know this game,\u201d I told him, barely audible.He stared into my eyes, thinning his own as if studying me. \u201cAll you need to know,\u201d he finally answered, \u201cis that you can\u2019t tap out.\u201dAbout the Author:Penelope ", "link": "http://www.corriethebookcrazedgirl.com/2015/11/release-day-blitz-corrupt-by-penelope.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "BACK TO SCHOOL Everyday Natural Makeup Tutorial | Mainly Drugstore Back To School Natural Everyday Makeup Tutorial using Mainly Drugstore / Affordable Products.\n\nThe DUFF is all about honest friendships, girl power, acceptance and self respect!

The warrior who\u2019s arrival is anticipated by the universe. When the darkness tries to prevail over the light once again; it is he who must arise. Wielding the sword with the soul of the elements, where can one find this mythical hero in such a time of need? Look no farther than the young sassy prince of Arcudia, Larz. When his planet is invaded by the dastardly cruel master of darkness, Exxion, for Larz it is merely a time to be ruler and protect his land. The reality of the situation becomes apparent when his wife, Elluna, is kidnapped in the process of the attack. Once he finds out he is the legendary Light Spark, his journey becomes much more than a quest to save his soul mate, Elluna. And so book club decides to rub in my face that I read 26 pages of The Fifth Wave but doesn't do so with Light Spark, which I only read 25 pages. I actually wanted to stop at approximately 12 pages in, but that wouldn't do the book any justice.But I swear, they're just trying to pick on little authors.Okay, the two who enjoy \"torturing\" me agree with me. I have Snow Like Ashes above their heads. One of them has that AND Zeroboxer. I'm the cause of their fanning! Even if they won't ever, ever admit it. But that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m insulted. >_<Here's why I didn't continue Light Spark:No pronunciation guide or glossary in the book, which would have been extremely helpful to have. Words such as Aucudia and Exxion, and I'm pretty sure a glowing blue thing around a sword is involved that I don't even remember the name for. Mons luna? O_OI just butchered that like my mother butchers most people's names. I'm great with guessing the pronunciation of most words, but that does not mean everyone is like me. I'll tell you right now that is far too many \u2013 imagine: over seven billion! Mind = BLOWN.Larz and Darz. I half expected Marz to pop out of the pages in my face. In fact, I thought it was part of the culture, and expected Larz's and Elluna's future kid to be named between the varying lines of Delluna and Warz. What a fantastic play of words.(I'm not allowed to complain about Marz. Bookwyrm derived from a changing letter in bookworm. But I'm terrible at blog naming, and there was no such thing as Bookwyrming Thoughts until late 2012, so that's okay, right?)Language \u2013 too casual. Yes, it's been discussed Requadt has a purpose to the casual language being used in Light Spark. I just feel it's a little too casual to use something like, \"HOW YA DOIN, MAN!\" (fist bumps ensue) in a fantasy book. (Gabriel does not necessarily use those words exactly \u2013 that's just my example of how the language is used casually.)And the first chapter started out with such elegant prose, it was too formal (I sort of liked it, honestly). I do, however, applaud Gabriel for keeping readers in mind with the language and taking the overly formal path where it is blatantly obvious and weird and just sticks out like a random thimble being worn outside of sewing.Too much cheese. The villain? *dons evil little hat from a galaxy far, far away* \"Muahahaha, watch out little good guy, I'm going to take over your planet soon! Muahahaha.\" *marches upon ship with flourish* Prepare to depart, minions.Anyways, back to the cheese grilling (cheesy joke time: grilled cheese sandwiches! Get it?). The fight scenes, unfortunately, were boring. Slash, slash, slice, slice.Okay, that sounds worse than it really is. Regardless, the fight scenes just didn't feel as awesome as I hoped.Too cheery. The beginning of the book is so happy, I felt nauseous. Everyone gets along just dandy and the entire planet is happy, happy, happy.Most of that being thrown together? Nope, not going to work out too well with me. Especially that really happy aspect all over. Of course, it gets darker. Did I want to stick around? No. I was done at villain cheeseburger.And here I hoped my good reading streak would continue.1 OwlNote: Originally, I did not want to write a review, primarily due to the fact that as one of the very, very few reviews out there over this book, I could potentially hurt the author (I am technically the only unbiased review). However, via the school librarian, Gabriel did want to see a review, despite the negativity (wish granted).Thanks for stopping by! If you enjoyed reading this post, please consider leaving a comment.

What\u2019s not to love? But New Orleans\u2019 most esteemed member of the historical undead is headed for trouble. He\u2019s determined to reclaim Le Diligent, his gold-laden schooner lost at sea in 1814 and recently found at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico near Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana.  The U.S. Coast Guard and the Terrebonne Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office might beg to differ.  New Orleans wizard sentinel DJ Jaco and her merman friend Rene Delachaise can either lock up their friend Lafitte or join him on a road trip to Cajun country in order to save him from himself. Terrebonne Parish\u2014not to mention its jail\u2014might never be the same after the events of the all-new novella Pirateship Down, presented here along with a collection of urban fantasy stories and essays.  Wizards and Cajun merfolk, sexy shapeshifters and undead French pirates. Welcome to the world of the Sentinels of New Orleans in this collection, along with a little Louisiana lagniappe. No previous knowledge of the series required!Available at AmazonExcerpt:  About five minutes passed before I heard Jean Lafitte in the hallway of the prison, having a spirited, if one-sided, argument about Spanish fruit. I definitely heard the words orange and Spaniard. And the pirate never had anything nice to say about Spaniards since he\u2019d spent most of his human life plundering their ships.The door opened, and he strode into the room, sending my empathic senses into overload with the force of his outrage. I closed my eyes and tried to squelch the urge to bray like a donkey, because the source of his anger was obvious.They\u2019d taken away the cord he used to tie back his shoulder-length, wavy black hair, but that wasn\u2019t the problem. The problem was his fluorescent orange jumpsuit with Terrebonne Parish Prison stamped on the back. The suit was tight across his shoulders and baggy across his hips, obviously not tailored for the pirate\u2019s athletic build, and the pants were three inches too short and flashing bare calf. He wore short white athletic socks someone had scrounged up for him. Obviously, his pirate boots had been confiscated. It wasn\u2019t an outfit designed to please a man as arrogant and aware of his good looks as my undead pirate.Jean shifted his commentary from his guard to me. \u201cDrusilla, a grievance must be made against these ruffians and thieves. They have stolen my clothing and given me only this\u2026this\u2026.\u201d He ran out of words.\u201cUgly-ass orange jumpsuit?\u201d I offered, always ready to help Jean with his command of modern English.  \u201cOui, exactement. I demand that you obtain my release, tout de suite. And you must know, a woman who allows her husband to remain in such conditions for an entire evening must face reprimand.\u201dI leaned back in the chair and crossed my arms. \u201cAnd you must know that, in this day and age, should a man reprimand his wife too much, said wife might leave her husband to enjoy a longer time in his prison cell wearing his ugly-ass orange jumpsuit.\u201dThe guard who\u2019d accompanied Jean into the room listened to this exchange with no expression. Now that Jean and I were both in silent mode, he leaned over to fasten the handcuffs to a ring on the center of the table, which forced the irate pirate to sit down.  \u201cYou got half an hour,\u201d the guard said. \u201cI\u2019ll be right outside. If I hear or see anything through that door that I should not hear or see, visitation will be ended. That includes shouting, moving of furniture, excessive use of profanity, or sexual activity. Do you understand?\u201dI nodded. \u201cNot a problem.\u201d I had a confusion potion with Jean\u2019s name on it in my shoe, and I wasn\u2019t afraid to use it.  My ReviewSo, there's a whole lot of goodness in this book. In between each short story, Ms Johnson gives some more insight into the world she's created. How the magical community came to be, where they are from, how they work. She even included each species and an explanation. AND she put all the deets on Jean Lafitte. I was impressed with the history she's found, and I'm quite familiar with him, being from where I am. Anyways, I will give a little review for each story in here and what not, but sorry, no spoilers. :) \u00a0 Talk Like A PirateI about pissed my pants laughing at this one. I am not even lying. At first I was mad, because this girl, Megan, did something stupid. LOL She has the same name as me, but it's spelled different so I let it go. She summoned Jean Lafitte. And her Bestie, Rhyn, is stuck to deal with him because Megan is not handling it. So, Rhyn agrees to take Jean to his friend's home. Ok, the car ride is the best.

Each comic is a series of screen captures from the movies with in- and out-of-character speech bubbles added.\n\u201cImagine a gaggle of modern hack-n-slash roleplayers who had somehow never been exposed to the original Tolkien mythos, and then imagine taking those players and trying to introduce them to Tolkien via a \u2018D&D\u2019 campaign.\u201d\u00a0 Shamus Young, author of \u2018DM of the Rings.\u2019\nAfter each comic, the creator, Shamus Young, provides more insight into the workings of the roleplaying group I remember from my youth. I read the entire series to my kids for night-time reading years ago and we all found it quite hilarious. It was after my children\u2019s introduction to Dungeons & Dragons, and we had already read and watched Lord of the Rings, so they were in on most of the jokes. There are some jokes throughout that were not really age-appropriate and a few recurring gags I just didn\u2019t care for. While reading, I would either modify on the fly, skip, or just discuss when we reached them. It\u2019s nothing worse than you\u2019d expect at a table of 15- to 25-year-old D&D players, though. Overall and for the majority of the pages the writing was funny, poking fun at what many of us have experienced at the roleplaying table as both a DM as well as a player.\nClearly the players have not read the extensive backstories provided by the DM. Just like your typical gamers they\u2019re just after the loot. Image from \u2018DM of the Rings\u2019 created by Shamus Young.\nShamus Young sort of fell into the role of creating a webcomic. He made the first page of the comic to try out some new computer software he had, then on day two when he posted he commented, \u201cA couple of people were foolish enough to encourage me yesterday, so now I\u2019m inflicting another one on you.\u201d From this, DM of the Rings was born!\nIn checking out Shamus Young\u2019s website, Twenty Sided, I see he\u2019s been involved in two more comics. Chainmail Bikini, created with Shawn Gaston\u00a0\u201cfocused on a group of players running through a horrible, railroading, stupid, contrived, and painfully ill-conceived roleplaying campaign.\u201d Stolen Pixels, written for The Escapist is a comic based around video game screenshots. Shamus, was a software engineer when this all started, but has since become a novelist and has written two books, The Witch Watch\u00a0and How I Learned. I have not read any of these works yet, but, given my enjoyment of DM of the Rings, I\u2019m going to give them all a look-see, starting with the webcomics.

Together with the cyborg mechanic, Cinder, and her allies, Winter might even have the power to launch a revolution and win a war that\u2019s been raging for far too long.Can Cinder, Scarlet, Cress, and Winter defeat Levana and find their happily ever afters (goodreads)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost series enders wish they could be as epic as Winter!\n\n\n\n\nPlot: Before diving into Winter I recommend giving the series, as a whole, a reread. I know your instinct will be \"GIVE ME NOW,\" but trust me, you'll want the refresher. That being said, boy, is Winter epic! There was never a lull in the action and it was easy to lose an entire day to this book. Winter is a daunting 830 pages, but honestly it flies. This is in part that Meyer tells chapters from different perspectives and is constantly switching the teams up. Although Winter is Snow White inspired, I felt that the biggest retelling aspect of Winter was Queen Levana acting as the evil jealous step-mother. I would have liked more similarities between Snow White and Winter, but as a series ender, I have no complaints.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCharacters: Jacin and Winter are my favorite couple in the entire series and I want MORE. I knew that I was going to love Winter from the first glimpse we got of her from Cress and Fairest only piqued my curiosity. I was sad that there didn't seem to be any more development in Winter that we hadn't seen in Cress. There was definitely more Winter as a person, but I wanted more exploration of her character. Regardless, she and Jacin pulled at my heartstrings and had me in tears a few times (if you wanted to make a Jacin/Winter novella Marissa, I would have NO qualms).\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe old crew is back and I realized that one of my favorite aspects of The Lunar Chronicles is the genuine friendship between all of the characters. I loved their banter and just how loyal they were to each other.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWorld Building: If you've read Fairest, you've already gotten a glimpse of life on Luna, and that was just the tip of the iceberg. There were times where I couldn't help but compare Winter to the Hunger Games because the lifestyle on Luna was very similar to that of the Capitol: people in the palace living a lavish lifestyle while the outer sectors have rationed meals and basically live in a police state.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShort N Sweet: Winter is a satisfying conclusion to a beloved series, I'm just sad to see it go.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow that that's over...\n\n\n\n\n\nI really love Winter and Jacin. Like I REALLY love them. I love the whole idea of falling in love with someone of a different station that yourself and Jacin's dedication to Winter is out of this world.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLast week I was feeling nostalgic and going through all the bands I was obsessed with during my high school and university years. I came across Wolftron's Mare Crisium and I couldn't stop thinking about how it described Winter and Jacin's relationship. AND HOW FITTING IS THIS, MARE CRISIUM IS ACTUALLY ON THE MOON SOOO FATE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "link": "http://dulivre.blogspot.com/2015/11/book-review-winter.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Product With HYALURONIC ACID (HA) + ARGIRELINE + MATRIXYL - Clinically Proven To Reduce Wrinkles And Fine Lines | Advanced Skinceuticals For Celebrity Skin | 100% Satisfaction GUARANTEE!

This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.Hotel Ruby by Suzanne Young Published by Simon Pulse on November 3rd 2015 Genres: Horror & Ghost Stories, Mystery, Young Adult Pages: 288 \u2022Format: ARC \u2022Source: ALA Goodreads \n\n\n\nStay Tonight. Stay Forever.\nWhen Audrey Casella arrives for an unplanned stay at the grand Hotel Ruby, she\u2019s grateful for the detour. Just months after their mother\u2019s death, Audrey and her brother, Daniel, are on their way to live with their grandmother, dumped on the doorstep of a DNA-matched stranger because their father is drowning in his grief.\nAudrey and her family only plan to stay the night, but life in the Ruby can be intoxicating, extending their stay as it provides endless distractions\u2014including handsome guest Elias Lange, who sends Audrey\u2019s pulse racing. However, the hotel proves to be as strange as it is beautiful. Nightly fancy affairs in the ballroom are invitation only, and Audrey seems to be the one guest who doesn't have an invite. Instead, she joins the hotel staff on the rooftop, catching whispers about the hotel\u2019s dark past.\nThe more Audrey learns about the new people she's met, the more her curiosity grows. She\u2019s torn in different directions\u2014the pull of her past with its overwhelming loss, the promise of a future that holds little joy, and an in-between life in a place that is so much more than it seems\u2026\nWelcome to the Ruby.\nHotel Ruby was another coveted addition to my collection thanks to ALA this summer in San Francisco. I had heard some buzz about the book prior to the event, and the cover was absolutely stunning. When I found out that Suzanne Young was going to be signing ARCs of either Hotel Ruby or her \u201cThe Program\u201d books, I knew I wanted to opt for Hotel Ruby because it has a total Tower of Terror Vibe to it from the synopsis (I am a huge fan of the Tower of Terror ride at the Disney resorts, and I love the haunting and art-deco atmosphere, which I was hoping would come across in this novel). I started the book on Halloween weekend and was prepared for an eerie, glamorous tale. Unfortunately, while Hotel Ruby provided vivid imagery and a creative concept, the plot and mystery elements were predictable and one-dimensional.\nSetting\nI\u2019m all about giving credit where credit is due, and though I may have been underwhelmed overall by this book, the setting that Suzanne Young created was very atmospheric to read about, from the lavish hotel lobby to the decadent parties and opulent guest rooms. The gilded elevator doors on the book\u2019s cover promise a mysterious, beautifully haunting setting and Suzanne Young delivers. I enjoyed seeing the different levels of the hotels and the bits of history that made up each one.\nPlot\nA common theme I\u2019ve come across in most bloggers\u2019 reviews of Hotel Ruby is that they guessed the \u201ctwist\u201d early on. While this was definitely true for me, I wasn\u2019t too disappointed by that fact because I sort of went into the novel already assuming I was supposed to know what the twist was .[View post to see spoiler] I don\u2019t think a book\u2019s worth is solely determined by how predictable or not the plot twist is, but rather on how well the plot is executed. However, the plot really felt clumsy to me. I felt that not only did it take an extraordinarily long time for Audrey to figure out what was going on despite some glaring clues, but there was no real explanation for the paranormal elements. They just happened, and even those apart of the paranormal elements really didn\u2019t know why they were or how the rules of the book\u2019s universe functioned further than \u201cwe\u2019re just on separate dimensional planes.\u201d Characters also kept mentioning that the Ruby was alive and had a will of it\u2019s own, but there were never any details expanded upon that either (there\u2019s so much that could be done with a beautiful, haunted, passive-aggressive hotel!) When I read a thriller that\u2019s going to delve into the paranormal I demand that a thorough explanation is given, even if it\u2019s one not plausible in \u201creal life.\u201d An author has so much creative license in their work to develop any sort of world building rules that they want, and it\u2019s a shame to see such a missed opportunity in Hotel Ruby.\nRomance\nThis book probably falls under my list of \u201ctop ten book offenders of insta love.\u201d While I know that with a book set only over a few days the author had less time to develop a romance, it felt so inauthentic that I found my eyes glazing over at the romance scenes. This book really didn\u2019t need a romance, it could\u2019ve focused more on the mystery and tragedy without having to add a obligatory teenage infatuation I-just-met-you-but-I-would-die-for-you situation. I haven\u2019t read Suzanne\u2019s \u201cThe Program\u201d series, but I hope that the romance is more believable that it was in Hotel Ruby.\nCharacters\nNone of the characters in Hotel Ruby were particularly likeable, w", "link": "http://girlinthepages.com/2015/11/16/why-you-wont-catch-me-extending-my-stay-anytime-soon/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Finn\u2019s Rocket Book Blast $25 Amazon or Paypal #Giveaway {Ends 11/29} Mother Daughter Book Reviews  is pleased to be coordinating a Book Blast for \u201cFinn\u2019s Rocket: A Surfer Catches Air\u201c, the third book in the \u201cFinn\u2019s Fast Books\u201d middle grade series by Serena Schreiber.\n\n\u00a0\nAbout the Book\nTitle: Finn\u2019s Rocket: A Surfer Catches Air (Finn\u2019s Fast Books, Book #3) | Author: Serena Schreiber  | Publication Date: November 1, 2015 | Publisher: Independent | Pages: 176 | Recommended Ages: 7 to 12\n\nAmazon * Goodreads\nBook Description:\nFinn\u2019s summer vacation plans didn\u2019t include leaving the planet.\nWhen his little sister gets kidnapped from space camp, Finn will do anything and go anywhere to get her back.

I value honesty and the power of words, both written and audible. It\u2019s not in my nature to stay silent, especially concerning injustice i.e. Animal Cruelty, etc.\u00a0 Would you rather be able to read or be able to read minds (but be illiterate)?I can do both. Haha. Read. I\u2019d find reading people\u2019s minds an invasion of their privacy, unless it was to help them.\u00a0 Would you rather be able to speak fluently every language in the world or be the best in the world at something of your choosing? Be the best in the world at something. Reason being I love the fact that learning another language is a feeling of achievement and an exciting challenge. I wouldn\u2019t want that challenge made easy.\u00a0 Would you rather read only one book over and over for the rest of your life or read as many as you want but never remember what they\u2019re about?Oh, tough one. Well, if you can\u2019t remember there\u2019s not much point. Seems like a waste of time and effort for nothing, so I\u2019d go for reading one book and that would be J.M. Barrie\u2019s Peter Pan (aka Peter and Wendy). The best fantasy book ever written in my opinion. So simple but yet such Genius.\u00a0 Would you rather only the first page of a book or the last page?Last Page. I always have to find out how a story ends.\u00a0 Would you rather read 5 pages per day or 5 books per week?Five books a week if I could and had the time. Knowledge is power.\u00a0 Would you rather read only one genre forever or never read the same genre more than once? One genre forever because you\u2019d quickly run out of genres, right? And there\u2019s plenty of amazing books and various sub-genres to be found in the Sci-Fi and Horror genre. Not so much in the romance genre.\u00a0 Would you rather be invisible or be able to read minds?Invisible. Would be so much fun but not if it\u2019s like the Predator or Hollowman/The Invisible Man. That would suck.\u00a0 Would you rather never use the internet again or never watch TV again?Never watch TV again. There\u2019s too much sad news and superficial reality shows on TV these days and not to mention a cluster of commercials. Yes, give me the Internet, so I can watch the art, music, movies I want and keep in contact with those I love around the world. Much better than a one way street of TV.\u00a0 Would you rather have one wish granted today or three granted in 10 years?Definitely one wish granted today. Life is unpredictable and short. We\u2019re not guaranteed anything. Also, I hate waiting. Patience is a virtue. Possess it if you can. Seldom in a woman, but never in a man.\u00a0 Would you rather know it all or have it all?Have it all. I\u2019m a deep enough thinker and have a strong enough imagination as it is and that can be quite exhausting. So, knowing it all would drive me crazy. Plus, one would be viewed as pretentious and arrogant if they had the ability to know it all. And both are not good attributes. =)\u00a0 Three brothers born to a once powerful King were abandoned at birth and cast out into the old world as orphans - alone and unaware of the other's existence or their royal heritage.In the new world, by order of the false King, three of the most lethal assassins are sent to kill the children before they come of age and avenge their father\u2019s throne.But when the brothers find one another, Benjamin, Tommy and Sebastian must resist the temptation of magic and power if they are to defeat the unspeakable evil that has threatened them since birth.The Three Thorns is book one in an exciting children\u2019s fantasy series called The Brotherhood and the Shield from debut author Michael Gibney.Chapters Indigo | Amazon | Barnes & Noble | Kobo |", "link": "http://readingwithcupcakes.blogspot.com/2015/11/super-middle-grade-mondays-author.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Release Blitz: My Soul To Keep by Kennedy Ryan \n\nSynopsis\n\nIt seems the things worth keeping are often the hardest to hold...\n\nKAI\n\nI had two things in life that mattered.

It\u2019s the thing that\u2019s pushed me right out of backwoods Georgia into Los Angeles, where the line between fantasy and reality shimmers and blurs. I\u2019m finally making my way, making my mark. I can\u2019t afford to fall for one of music's brightest stars. Not now. Music is all I have left, and I\u2019m holding on tight with both hands.

The only constant, it\u2019s taken me to heights most people only dream about; a gift dropped in my lap at birth. I thought it was enough. I thought it was everything until I met Kai. Now she\u2019s all I think about, like a song I can't get out of my head. If I have to chase her, if I have to give up everything - I will.

And as much as I want to be, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ll never forget seeing my Mama in bed for days after Daddy left. And even though she got up, I suspect a part of her never left that bed, but just stayed there, waiting. We had to leave the house where she grew up and where I spent my first years, because Daddy left us with nowhere to go. Mama learned to stand on her two feet, and I\u2019ve done the same.

He traps my chin between two fingers, taking my mouth in a paradox of rough and tender. I want to move. To slide away from his body pressing me into the pool table. But I can\u2019t. Not with his hand caressing my back. Not with his tongue in my mouth. Not with his erection pressing into my stomach. I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t. I have been denying myself this, and I\u2019m so damn hungry. My mouth opens under his, ravenous and wet and hot. His groan vibrates against my lips.\n\u201cYes. Good God, yes, Pep.\u201d His words slip down my throat.\nI strain up on tiptoes, clawing my fingers into his dark hair, forcing him closer. He lifts me onto the pool table, planting himself between my knees. His fingers skim my bare thigh, working up my leg until he reaches a damp patch of silk. He pushes my panties aside, rubbing his hand into the wet flesh there before sliding one long finger and then another inside of me. I rock into these fingers which have awed millions with their skill. They own me. I\u2019m the instrument in his hands. He\u2019s playing me. Plucking at me. Strumming me.\nHe tugs at the wide neck of my sweater until it falls away from my shoulder, slipping his hand in and cupping my naked breast. He brushes his fingers over my nipple, and I lose my mind and every inhibition. My head flops back and I stretch my legs wider, offering him anything he wants.\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d His question burns the vulnerable curve of my neck as he drags his lips to my shoulder. \u201cYou come here wearing no bra and think I won\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nHe abandons the words, his dark, untidy head disappearing under my sweater, and before I have time to regain even millimeters of sanity, my nipple is in his mouth and he\u2019s suckling me. Not gentle. Not soft. My breasts are so small, he almost eats me whole. Every draw, every suck, every bite sends a power surge to my core until my knees hold his hips in a desperate grip, and my nails rake across the flat surface of the pool table behind me.\nHis mouth at my breast. His fingers inside me. His clean scent surrounding me. I have nowhere to hide anymore. I am exposed. I want to spread myself wide open for him. That voice that has been telling me I can\u2019t rely on him. I can\u2019t trust him. I can\u2019t need him\u2014that voice is stunned into silence by his thorough possession of my body, by the inferno between my legs, blazing a hole right through my soul and scorching my heart.\nBuy Links\n\nhttp://ift.tt/1HRbE3Z\n\nGiveaway\n\na Rafflecopter giveaway \n\nPlaylist\n\n        \nAbout Kennedy Ryan\n\nI just can't write about myself in third person for one more bio!

The park is also available for personal tours, birthday parties and private functions, WGHP reports.\nThe photos are part of a book that Lawless recently published entitled \u201cBizarro,\u201d which highlights abandoned amusement parks across the country. Lawless is known for his photos of urban decay and abandoned spaces.\nWhen Oz was open year-round, tourists could explore Dorothy\u2019s farmhouse, meet their favorite characters from the movie and participate in a hot air balloon ride.\nWatauga Lake Magazine reported that the park had 400,000 visitors during its first summer in 1970.

My nightmares, however, became my obsession.His name is Michael Crist. My boyfriend\u2019s older brother is like that scary movie that you peek through your hand to watch. He is handsome, strong, and completely terrifying. The star of his college\u2019s basketball team and now gone pro, he\u2019s more concerned with the dirt on his shoe than me. But I noticed him.I saw him. I heard him. The things that he did, and the deeds that he hid\u2026For years, I bit my nails, unable to look away. Now, I\u2019ve graduated high school and moved on to college, but I haven\u2019t stopped watching Michael. He\u2019s bad, and the dirt I\u2019ve seen isn\u2019t content to stay in my head anymore. Because he\u2019s finally noticed me. Her name is Erika Fane, but everyone calls her Rika.My brother\u2019s girlfriend grew up hanging around my house and is always at our dinner table. She looks down when I enter a room and stills when I am close. I can always feel the fear rolling off of her, and while I haven\u2019t had her body, I know that I have her mind. That\u2019s all I really want anyway.Until my brother leaves for the military, and I find Rika alone at college.In my city.Unprotected. The opportunity is too good to be true as well as the timing. Because you see, three years ago she put a few of my high school friends in prison, and now they\u2019re out.We\u2019ve waited. We\u2019ve been patient. And now every last one of her nightmares will come true.***Corrupt is stand-alone dark eroticaI turned and stalked off, taking a left down the hallway toward the elevator. The doors opened as soon as I pushed the button, and I stepped inside, trying to calm my racing heart. They still intimidated me. And excited me. And challenged me. And knotted me up. I\u2019d kind of wanted to go to a party but not with them. The doors started closing, but just then a hand shot into the elevator, and I jumped, seeing the doors re-open. I sucked in a breath, staring wide-eyed as Michael reached in, grabbed my shirt by the collar with one hand, and pulled me out. \u201cMichael!\u201d I shouted. I stumbled into him, and before I knew what was happening, he grabbed my wrists and locked them behind my back, walking into me and forcing me backward, back down the hall toward the kitchen.\u201cLet me go!\u201d I demanded, my lips brushing the tip of his chin. \u201cI don\u2019t know, guys,\u201d he teased over my head, \u201cshe still seems pretty fucking easy to push around. What do you think?\u201dLaughter greeted me as he forced me back into the living area. Every muscle in my body was on fire, and the tips of my toes kept getting caught under his sneakers. I twisted my body, trying to break his hold. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201dI pushed against his chest and jerked my body to the left, tearing out of his hold with every muscle I could muster. I stumbled, losing my balance, and fell backward, crashing to the floor. Pain shot through my ass, running down my legs as the fall knocked the wind out me.  Shit!Shooting my hands behind me, I pushed myself up and bent my knees, looking up at him as he advanced. He stalked over and then stopped, towering over me.  I immediately moved my hands and feet, crawling backward, away from him. But then I felt something at my back, and I halted. I twisted my head, seeing a dark pant leg, and I didn\u2019t know if it was Damon, Will, or Kai, but it didn\u2019t matter. I was closed in. Oh, no. I slowly raised my eyes, seeing Michael\u2019s lips tilt in a devious smile. I stopped breathing, seeing him lower his body to the floor, planting his knees between my bent legs, and his hands at my sides.  My neck arched back as his face hovered over mine, but I tried to keep myself up as much as possible, no matter how close his body got. \u201cI thought you were one of us,\u201d his whispered, his breath caressing my lips. \u201cI thought you could play.\u201dI stilled, staring into his eyes. You\u2019re one of us now. Will had said that to me on that night so long ago. Michael\u2019s amber eyes searched mine and then dropped to my mouth, his breathing growing heavy as he stared at me like he was about to take a bite. I wanted to cry. What the hell was going on?Three years ago was nearly the happiest night of my life, and it quickly became the worst. And ever since then, Michael not only acted as if I didn\u2019t exist, but also, at times, as if he wished I didn\u2019t. Now the guys were free, and they were all back together again. What did I have to do with any of this? What did he want with me?\u201cI don\u2019t know this game,\u201d I told him, barely audible. He stared into my eyes, thinning his own as if studying me. \u201cAll you need to know,\u201d he finally answered, \u201cis that you can\u2019t tap out.\u201da Rafflecopter giveaway Meet Penelope:Penelope Douglas is a writer and teacher in Las Vegas.

Connect with the Author:  Website | Twitter | Facebook | Pinterest | Tumblr | Instagram   \u00a0     Winter in Black Orchard, Wisconsin, is long and dark, and sixteen-year-old Vayda Silver prays the snow will keep the truth and secrecy of the last two years buried. Hiding from the past with her father and twin brother, Vayda knows the rules: never return to the town of her mother\u2019s murder, and never work a Mind Game where someone might see. No one can know the toll emotions take on Vayda, how emotion becomes energy in her hands, or how she can\u2019t control the destruction she causes. But it\u2019s not long before her powers can no longer be contained. The truth is dangerously close to being exposed, placing Vayda and her family at risk. Until someone quiets the chaos inside her. Unwanted. That\u2019s all Ward Ravenscroft has ever been. To cope, he numbs the pain of rejection by denying himself emotions of any kind. Yet Vayda stirs something in him. He can\u2019t explain the hold she has on him\u2013inspiring him with both hope and fear. He claims not to scare easily, except he doesn\u2019t know what her powers can do. Yet.

After so many previous posts where I say \"I don't really read graphic novels,\" I think we're at the point where that would be a lie. I do read graphic novels but I'm just new to the entire thing. I'm still asking for recommendations and often a little lost wondering if I'm picking up the right book and whether or not there was a previous volume. Still, I'm reading graphic novels and actively looking for more. I get the sense of accomplishment when I read a graphic novel over the course of a night but I also have found I really adore the materials I've read and the artwork involved.\u00a0So here we are, another graphic novel, and one that was suggested to me. When I looked up TW+TD I nearly got the wrong book (whoops) until I spotted the first volume. The cover alone captured my attention and it only was further captured as I read the blurb about it:\u00a0Every ninety years, twelve gods incarnate as humans. They are loved. They are hated. In two years, they are dead. The team behind critical tongue-attractors like Young Avengers and PHONOGRAM reunite to create a world where gods are the ultimate pop stars and pop stars are the ultimate gods. But remember: just because you\u2019re immortal, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to live forever. Collects THE WICKED + THE DIVINE #1-5Sounds awesome, no? When I grabbed the graphic novel I flipped through the pages and fell in love with the artwork. I am not sure if there's a difference between graphic novels that seem to worship art as much as the story, there definitely is a difference from them and some comics I've read, which are crammed with small imagery and a lot of dashed fonts, but I think I prefer the type of graphic novel that TW+TD falls into. The colorful, clean artwork is just so beautiful and bright!For me, it took a hot minute to adjust to the full story. I wasn't entirely sure if we were being introduced to the gods bit by bit, if they were just arriving in this cycle on Earth, or what. As we start off the graphic novel, the gods have already been welcomed to the present day for this particular cycle. They were normal people, living their lives until suddenly they were informed they were gods. That's when the memories returned and people began to love and hate them. The world knows of this occurrence and the gods have many fans--people who flock to worship them and hope, desperately, that they may be one of the various gods that come back in cycles.We're quickly introduced to a handful of these gods, while others remain a mystery, and it's to my utter surprise that I became completely enamored with Lucifer and the modern day interpretation of her (yes, her). The character development is a little sloppy at first because our main character (an utter fangirl named Laura) is already privy to all of the gods who are out in the open while we, the mere readers, are not. Slowly you catch on and before long, you're in the middle of it as Luci (Lucifer) is blamed for a murder and Laura tries to help prove her innocence.It's fast paced and you're stuck from beginning to end and thank goodness I had chosen to pick up the second book when I bought the first because I dove right into that one as soon as I was done. But gosh, the imagery of this book, I fawn over it whenever I view it.If you want to read this, be sure you have the second book close by!", "link": "http://soonrememberedtales.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-wicked-divine-vol-1-faust-act.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Great Toddler Boy Gift Ideas \u00a0If you need great toddler boy gift ideas, check out the neat things we have picked out.

It will benefit your heart, your self, your art and your creative practice. \n\n\n\n~{Reposting this essay from March 2011}~We're governed by rules and we impose rules {trivial and not so} on ourselves -- things like no coffee after 2pm or always vacuum on Mondays -- so it's not surprising that we make rules for our art.A two page spread has to be worked as one big wide page.Don't tear out pages.Every page has to have words or journaling.The words have to be cool & trendy.The colors I choose have to \"go\" together.A page has to be finished in one sitting.You can't art journal on canvas.I have to use {insert brand name of art materials here}.Pages must be worked in order.My pages have to look like those of {insert cool art journalist's name here}.Don't brag. Don't bitch. Don't be a downer. Don't get too personal.Don't cut up your journal pages.You can't work in seven journals at once.The composition must be pleasing.\n\nAll of the above are certified 100% without a doubt, officially, undeniably wrong. Art journaling has no rules. It is whatever you want it to be. It's not \"having\" finished pages but \"having created\" the pages that makes me happy. To put a rule on yourself misses the point. You CAN have a journal dedicated to something specific. You CAN have a journal of one style. You CAN finish a page in one sitting. But you don't have to. That's the thing.\n\nI don't like to follow rules in general, and certainly not in my art.The joy is in the play.\nPlease... tell me about your rules. I am curious to learn what constraints we put on our journals. What rules, spoken or un-, do you place on your art journaling or drawing? Do any of the rules speak to you? Do you have rules that you didn't realize you had?

Leaving a sold-out show in Phoenix, he rents a car and drives north and east, landing in the Painted Desert town of Rainbow Rock.Nearly three years after leaving her old life behind, Lottie Beale is feeding people and baking pies, managing the Kachina Caf\u00e9 and tending secrets of her own. When circumstances conspire to give two attractive people some time alone together amid the world-class vistas of the Four Corners, they discover more than either had bargained for.Amazon * Barnes and Noble\u00a0  \u00a0Excerpt:\u00a0\u201cRo-man! Ro-man!\u201d A capacity crowd in the Ak-Chin Pavilion chanted his name under the starry desert sky, but Roman Kincaid barely heard it. He stood in the stage wings, gearing up for an encore and wondering when his dream had become a nightmare. \u201cOkay, guys,\u201d he said to his back-up band via their ear buds. \u201cOne encore only. Let\u2019s do \u2018Gamble.\u2019 Start with the chorus.\u201d He took two steps toward the stage entrance, swinging his guitar into playing position. Sam, his manager, caught his elbow. \u201cAre you sure about this? That crowd adores you. You could probably play three encores, sell more CDs\u2014\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Roman left no room for argument. \u201cOne and done. And no backstage stuff, either. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d He took a deep breath, pasted on the same fake, crowd-pleasing smile he\u2019d used in the last half-dozen shows, and jogged back onto the stage to the roar of twenty thousand excited voices. He strummed the intro and launched into the chorus of his first number-one hit: \u201cLove is such a gamble. You break a new deck every time. Sometimes you\u2019re dealt the aces; Others you draw to nines. But when I met you, I knew it was true. A winning hand you seemed. Now I have the rush of a royal flush. You are the gamble of my dreams.\u201d The crowd cheered wildly as he played his way through the music he now sang in his sleep. In fact, he realized as he watched fans taking up the beat and clapping along, that was pretty much what he was doing now. He struggled to suppress a yawn during the guitar interlude as he turned to acknowledge his band. I spent my early life dreaming of a crowd like this. When did performing start to feel like a chore? He put the thought away. Lately he\u2019d been thinking of times when he\u2019d heard of some celebrity being hospitalized for exhaustion and assumed it was a euphemism for drug rehab. Now he wondered. When was the last time I felt truly rested? The question was an imponderable. Months, at least. He hit the last chord and took a deep bow, then shouted, \u201cThank you, Phoenix!\u201d and dashed off-stage.\u00a0 Meet Author Susan AylworthSusan Aylworth started her first book when she was nine. \"It was called Buff, The Proud Stallion.

The star of his college\u2019s basketball team and now gone pro, he\u2019s more concerned with the dirt on his shoe than me.\nBut I noticed him.\nI saw him. I heard him. The things that he did, and the deeds that he hid\u2026For years, I bit my nails, unable to look away.\nNow, I\u2019ve graduated high school and moved on to college, but I haven\u2019t stopped watching Michael.

That\u2019s all I really want anyway.\nUntil my brother leaves for the military, and I find Rika alone at college.\nIn my city.\nUnprotected.\nThe opportunity is too good to be true as well as the timing. Because you see, three years ago she put a few of my high school friends in prison, and now they\u2019re out.\nWe\u2019ve waited. We\u2019ve been patient.

My nightmares, however, became my obsession.\u00a0His name is Michael Crist.\u00a0My boyfriend\u2019s older brother is like that scary movie that you peek through your hand to watch. He is handsome, strong, and completely terrifying. The star of his college\u2019s basketball team and now gone pro, he\u2019s more concerned with the dirt on his shoe than me.\u00a0But I noticed him.\u00a0I saw him.\u00a0I heard him.\u00a0The things that he did, and the deeds that he hid...For years, I bit my nails, unable to look away.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019ve graduated high school and moved on to college, but I haven\u2019t stopped watching Michael. He\u2019s bad, and the dirt I\u2019ve seen isn\u2019t content to stay in my head anymore.\u00a0Because he\u2019s finally noticed me.\u00a0Michael\u00a0Her name is Erika Fane, but everyone calls her Rika.\u00a0My brother\u2019s girlfriend grew up hanging around my house and is always at our dinner table. She looks down when I enter a room and stills when I am close. I can always feel the fear rolling off of her, and while I haven\u2019t had her body, I know that I have her mind. That\u2019s all I really want anyway.\u00a0 Until my brother leaves for the military, and I find Rika alone at college.\u00a0In my city.\u00a0Unprotected.\u00a0The opportunity is too good to be true as well as the timing. Because you see, three years ago she put a few of my high school friends in prison, and now they\u2019re out.\u00a0We\u2019ve waited. We\u2019ve been patient. And now every last one of her nightmares will come true.Welcome to our Blog Tour stop for\u00a0Corrupt by Penelope Douglas.\u00a0You can follow the rest of the tour HERE\u00a0\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0\u2022 \u2022 \u2022I fell back to my feet and crept through my apartment as I listened to the pounding that had now become a steady attack. My feet followed the sound, stepping absently closer to it, and I finally pressed my ear against the wall leading to my hallway, my heart racing as the vibrations touched my skin.\u00a0 Resting my cheek against the surface, I swallowed the tight lump in my throat as the thumping against the wall grew faster and faster.\u00a0There was someone over there. In the empty apartment.\u00a0 Holding up my phone, I dialed the office downstairs but got no answer. I knew there was a night manager named Simon Something-Or-Other, but I didn\u2019t think many people were on duty at night. He must be away from his desk.\u00a0I continued listening, wondering if I could ignore it and just wait until morning to ask the manager about it, but the further down the hall I travelled, the louder it got until I was standing next to the rear entrance.\u00a0Opening up the door, I peeked my head into the hallway, holding the heavy steel exit open just enough to inspect.\u00a0 Glancing to my right, I saw a door just like mine. And then I heard a woman\u2019s high-pitched cry ring out around me, and I started breathing harder.\u00a0And then there was another cry. And another, and another, and...Was she having sex? My mouth fell open as I tried not to laugh.\u00a0Oh, my God.\u00a0But I thought the place was supposed to be empty.\u00a0I stepped out, knife in hand\u2014just in case\u2014and walked quietly down to the other door, glancing up and seeing small security cameras along the wall, probably installed when the apartments were built.\u00a0Pressing my ear to the door, I listened, still hearing the thump, thump, thump of something hitting the wall, and the girl\u2019s breathy cries over and over again.\u00a0I folded my lips between my teeth, covering my smile with my free hand.\u00a0But then the woman cried out. \u201c No! Ah, oh, God! Please!\u201d\u00a0And my face fell, hearing the fear in her voice. The short, shrill screams were now different. Panicked and scared, and her cries sounded struggled. My mouth suddenly went dry as I stood there listening.\u00a0\u201c Ah!\u201d  she cried out again. \u201c No, please stop!\u201d\u00a0I backed away from the door, not finding it funny anymore.\u00a0 But then something hit the door from the other side, making a loud thud,and I scurried backward. \u201c Oh, shit,\u201d\u00a0I gritted out under my breath.\u00a0I shot my head up to the cameras, now wondering if they fed to Securitydownstairs or to whoever was inside the apartment. Did they know I was out here?\u00a0I spun around and dashed for my door, grabbing the handle and trying to twist it.  But it was locked. \u201c Dammit!\u201d  I mouthed. Fucking thing must lock automatically.\u00a0Another thud hit the door, mere feet away from me\u2014so close\u2014and I darted my eyes over to it, my breathing turning fast and painful.\u00a0I pulled on the door handle again, twisting and yanking, but it didn\u2019t budge.\u00a0Another thud hit the door, and I jerked upright, dropping the knife.\u00a0\u201c Shit.\u201d\u00a0I dived down to pick it up, but just then I heard the other door swing open, so I bolted down the stairwell, hiding behind the wall and forgetting about the knife.\u00a0Fuck!\u00a0Screw this.

Keeping stories has been super important.\nWhen the big girls were young, I became a Creative Memories consultant in an effort to do three things. 1. Create their books. 2. Create them at cost. 3. Help others catch my passion to be a memory keeper as well. I was successful at all and I have shelves of beautiful scrapbooks to prove it.\nThen life happened and six little ones came home to their forever family so creating everything from scratch fell by the wayside. I could NOT print all those photos, collect all those supplies, and keep the mess out all the time. It was at this time I began writing my blog and scrapbook as I knew it came to an end.\nI began printing my blog each year and those books became my scrapbooks of memories.\nAs the littles came home I knew I wanted to create a Life Book\u00a0just for them. It would make a way for them to \u2018go back\u2019 and remember \u2018their China\u2019.\u00a0 The books have done just that. None of my children really remember their time before us but their books sure help them think they do. They are their all time favorite books too. Not a day goes by that one of them doesn\u2019t pull it off the shelf and want me to tell them THEIR story. It is fun for them to compare stories and see how the miracle of adoption has made us a family.\nGiving them back a part of their China story was very important to me and now one of their most precious possessions.\n5 Steps to Make a Life Book:\n\nMake up your mind to do it:\u00a0This might seem like a no brainer but certainly makes a difference in the time set aside to do so.\nGather all photos into one place:\u00a0It is more doable when you spend some time getting organized like gathering all photos needed for the project into one folder on your computer.\nCreate an account in Shutterfly:\u00a0Creating an account is a good place to start and will be used through all future projects.\nWork on the book in batches:\u00a0I find adding all the photos first is best. Then editing each one before adding the story. I include most all the photos of life in China before adoption, the time we were in country adopting, and some of the first weeks newly home.\nTell the story as if speaking to your child:\u00a0This story is for them and telling it as if speaking to them sure makes reading it special. Reading together when they are young will strengthen attachment and when older it will build confidence of their story.\n\nAs I was finishing up HollyMei\u2019s life book last night I found myself taking screenshots galore for a tutorial to show you how to make one. This morning it dawned on me to make a video tutorial so I messaged my sweet friend\u00a0Lisa Furey\u00a0because she is the guru of everything. I have taken several classes from her so she shared with me how to make my own tutorial. Thanks Lisa!!!\nVideo Tutorial to Make a Life Book at Shutterfly:\n\n\n\n\nPS. I thought you might need to see how large the photos show up in the book once published so here is a few pages from EC\u2019s Life Book~\n\nI sure hope this helps you decide to take the plunge and get publishing! I promise your kids will feel so very loved because of it!!!\n___________________________________\nShay Ankerich is mom to nine going on ten kids (seven from China), wife to Scott, and a homeschooling mom. \u00a0She loves Jesus, adoption, blogging, reading, photography, and crocheting.

The story opens with a very interesting scene that plays right into the drama that develops throughout the book and I was left wondering who was behind the deeds at every turn.Series: Scottish Highlander, #3My Rating:\u2740\u2740\u2740\u2740\u2740Genre: Historical RomanceThe heroine of this novel is Saidh, who appeared in the second book of the series, and who isn't everything a proper lady should be. Having grown up with seven brothers, she can brawl and swear, climb trees and wield a sword. She first catches Greer's attention because she's beautiful, but it's her temper and passionate love of life that wins his heart. I liked Saidh because she wasn't wiling to put up with any coddling and also because she sought to clear her cousin's name, even when she herself had some doubts about Fenella's innocence. I also loved that she stood toe to toe with all the men in her life and often came out on top!What sent me to wondering was who was after murdering Saidh and why. The logical answer seemed to be Fenella, but when that started to seem less likely, I was stumped. But I never saw who it really was coming!! I think Greer was also stunned by the identity of the villain and I have to say, there's a lot to love about Greer's character. He's not your usual laird. He's been a hired warrior, so he isn't as stoic or worried about duty as lairds tend to be at times. He knows how to have a good time, and he knew that Saidh wasn't merely someone he could have a good time with, and his first concern is to uphold her good reputation and so marries her. It's a hilarious scene, but you can see that Greer chooses Saidh for his wife with all the tongue tied adoration of a man really in love.A wonderful addition to the series, The Highlander Takes a Bride\u00a0was sweet, sexy and had a tightly woven plot that kept me turning the pages from beginning to end. I highly recommend this highlander series to anyone who is a fan of the genre.Happy Reading,Jewels", "link": "http://devastatingreads.blogspot.com/2015/11/review-highlander-takes-bride-by-lynsay.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "10 Skincare Essentials for Women in Their 40s \nIt happened practically overnight. That tiny crinkle at the corner of your eyes, which only appeared whenever you found something hilarious, has formed into a taunting wrinkle that won\u2019t go away and it\u2019s no laughing matter. All those sun-soaked days of summer\u2019s pasts? They\u2019re now pesky discoloration that not even heavy concealer can mask. Where did you go wrong?\n\n\n\n\nCan Rosehip Oil Give You Supermodel Skin?\n6 Ways to Fade a Bad Tan\nWe Tried It: An Indoor Surf Class\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the bad news: aging is inevitable. But the good news is you don\u2019t need to be blessed with perfect genetics to have youthful, glowing skin, no matter how old you really are. According to skincare experts, essential moisturizing products and a brand new skincare regimen are all you need to slow down the aging process and have softer, smoother features without caking on the makeup. Sure, Botox can easily eliminate that line or three, but fortunately, especially for those with needle phobias, there are other options that don\u2019t require the unwanted pinch and are just as safe.\nWhile experts say you should begin looking into anti-aging products once you hit the big 3-0, there\u2019s never a wrong time to revamp your regimen to keep looking as young as you feel. Find out what are the must-have skin essentials to keep those feared creases at bay. And check out the video above for five simple makeup tricks that can take years off your face.\n\nLose the Makeup, Gain a Doctor\n\n\u201cTo cover the signs of aging, women tend to overload on makeup and concealer, which can actually accentuate lines and wrinkles,\u201d explains Dr. Marina Peredo, associate clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. \u201cLess is more when it comes to makeup on a mature skin. Mineral makeup is best on all skin.\u201d However, avoid splurging on the latest products to hide those lines and instead, consider visiting your dermatologist every month. He/she can help you create the best skincare regimen for your features and those results will last longer than pricey foundation.\n\nCleanse, Cleanse, Cleanse\n\nWhether you do wear makeup daily or not, it\u2019s crucial to dedicate some time every day to thoroughly clean your face, preferably with a creamy cleanser that won\u2019t strip your skin of its natural moisture. And don\u2019t even think about getting lazy with this. No matter your age, it\u2019s important to wash your face before hitting the sheets. \u201cEven though it doesn\u2019t seem like such a big deal, sleeping with makeup on, especially around the eyes, leads to low level chronic inflammation and irritation, which brings inflammatory molecules to your cells,\u201d explains Dr. Jessica Krant, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in New York. \u201cThese cause direct damage, breaking down the rubbery, plump extracellular matrix that gives our skin its bounce and glow.\u201d\n\nBoost Up the Collagen\n\nCollagen, the protein that helps skin remain its elasticity, is crucial for maintaining youthful, glowing features. However, skin loses its tone with age as collagen wears down, resulting in those unwanted fine lines. However, you can increase the collagen in your skin. \u201cTopical vitamin A products are useful because of the ability to increase collagen synthesis in the skin and also temper discoloration of the skin,\u201d says Dr. Julia Tzu, clinical assistant professor of dermatology at New York University School of Medicine. \u201cThe over the counter version is retinol. The more powerful prescription version is tretinoin or tazarotene. Your local dermatologist can help you decide which type of topical vitamin A is best for you.\u201d\n\nDrink Plenty of Water\n\nAlways begin and end your day with cool, crisp water. But don\u2019t just stop there. Skip the sugary drinks and have water by your side at all times. Not only will it quench your thirst, but it will always keep your skin hydrated and supple. \u201cOnce you realize you\u2019re thirsty, you\u2019re already dehydrated, which takes its toll in your skin,\u201d says celebrity nutritionist JJ Virgin. \u201cAlways keep a canteen with purified water nearby to hydrate your cells so nutrients stay in and toxins get out. Proper hydration means you sweat more efficiently to keep your skin glowing and looking fabulous.\u201d Virgin recommends beginning your day with a glass of water to kick off healthier habits. As for cocktail hour? We\u2019re not saying to give it up completely, but do keep in mind that alcohol does dehydrate skin, so think twice before making it a double.\n\nSlather On the SPF\n\nExperts say your 40s are the right time to start using retinol if you haven\u2019t begun already, but there is one product you should be slathering on every day, no matter your age. \u201cNow is the time to really step up the sun-protective strategies with at least SPF 30 every day and also a hat if you are spending any longer than 5-10 minutes in the sun,\u201d says Dr. Elizabeth Tanzi, co-director of the Washington Institute of Dermatologic Laser Surgery. \u201cThe effe", "link": "http://news.health.com/2014/03/19/10-skincare-essentials-for-women-in-their-40s/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "What's Cookin' | Our Daily Meals | Hello friends!

I mean, it\u2019s just like riding a bike, right? Except I hadn\u2019t ridden a bike in over a decade, so, yeah, wasn\u2019t feeling too comfortable. \nAs if by divine intervention, it was at that exact time that I was invited to the launch of the Emily & Tony line of intimate products, where I met the lovely Dr. Emily Morse, acclaimed sex therapist/counselor/author and Bravo TV personality from the series Miss Advised. This created a long-distance love affair of sorts, where I began listening to Emily\u2019s podcasts\u00a0(listen to them, please, just do it) that touch on everything from toys to techniques and all manner of things in between. Emily is smart, completely approachable and very sweet, but she\u2019s stylish and gorgeous to boot. From dressing for sex to beauty and her own fitness routine, this is how the beautiful Emily does it\u2026. \nOn how to dress for the bedroom\u2026\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going out at night and then you\u2019re coming home later from a date or whatever, you\u2019ll want to wear something that you\u2019ll feel comfortable in that looks the most like an enhanced version of yourself. I love those gorgeous cream blushes and stains that work for both lips and cheeks, like Benefit Cosmetics BeneTint. They\u2019re easy, they\u2019re fast, and they\u2019re small enough to keep in your purse the next morning so you can just refresh your face. You want to be careful wearing makeup that\u2019s too heavy and/or will melt off your face.\nAlways make sure to choose things that make you feel sexy. Trends don\u2019t matter between the sheets: find something that makes you feel alluring and super amazing.\nI also think there\u2019s something to be said for letting this spill over into your everyday life. Don\u2019t wear anything that doesn\u2019t make you feel sexy. Throw out the bad underwear, the clothes that aren\u2019t comfortable and/or flattering. Always make sure you\u2019re wearing the underthings in which you feel your best. Bras have come a long way; now they make them without wires and hooks and things, and they\u2019re still incredibly flattering without being torturous.\nI also love wearing long tanks that can be worn as a dress. They\u2019re sneaky good: you can tuck them into your pants for day or for a date, but at night if you need to get up and go to the bathroom, you have a flattering little dress to lounge around in. Michael Stars makes some that are amazing. You just stretch them a little and they elongate. They\u2019re genius.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nA gal needs a good lighting scheme\u2026.\n\u201cCandles and lighting is key. There are so many women who absolutely refuse to have sex with the lights on, and it\u2019s the biggest turnoff for men. They\u2019re visual creatures, they want to be able to see you. Split the difference: light a candle. We make amazing massage candles that provide gorgeous light and the wax turns into hydrating massage oil, so it\u2019s a treat even if you just want to take some time for yourself and moisturize your skin. But, all that aside, men are visual creatures so make sure you have the lighting you want. Don\u2019t be the \u2018light\u2019s off\u2019 gal.\u201d\nSo, about that rumor that men prefer long hair vs. short hair\u2026.\n\u201cI think it depends on the man; one size doesn\u2019t fit all. I think there are some men who would never think of grabbing hair, but there are some men who are really into hair pulling. There are women out there who look amazing in pixie haircuts, and I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to kick them out of bed for that. I do think there\u2019s something generally sexy about longer hair, but I think the most important thing in general is for women to do what makes them feel sexy and make them feel empowered. If you want to chop off your hair, he may decide to slap your ass. Reactions will vary, so do what makes you feel good.\u201d\n\n\nSpeaking of feeling beautiful, what products is SHE using these days?\n\u201cBumble and Bumble Cr\u00e8me de Coco shampoo and conditioner is what I\u2019m using now. I also like Kevin Murphy Young Again Hair Oil because it protects against breakage and tames flyaways. As far as makeup goes, I love the feel of Smashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer Light; it glides over my skin, and absorbs quickly. Primer makes me feel like no matter how little time I spend on my whole makeup routine, it\u2019s something that will somehow make it all work out. I also love Smashbox Studio Skin 15-Hour Wear Foundation for long-lasting coverage, especially for on-camera work. There\u2019s also nothing better than the Urban Decay Naked Basics Palette. I love the colors; they all work well together. Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara is THE BEST. My lashes are amazing and almost better than sex (almost!) As far as fragrance goes, Jo Malone Nectarine & Honey Blossom cologne is such a fresh, happy scent.\u201d\n\n\n\nTurn off your ad blocker to view content\n\n\nNow, about that skincare routine\u2026\n\u201cI use a Clarisonic almost every night and face lotion and eye cream.

Mineral makeup is best on all skin.\u201d However, avoid splurging on the latest products to hide those lines and instead, consider visiting your dermatologist every month. He/she can help you create the best skincare regimen for your features and those results will last longer than pricey foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thinkstock)\n\nCleanse, Cleanse, Cleanse\nWhether you do wear makeup daily or not, it\u2019s crucial to dedicate some time every day to thoroughly clean your face, preferably with a creamy cleanser that won't strip your skin of its natural moisture. And don\u2019t even think about getting lazy with this. No matter your age, it\u2019s important to wash your face before hitting the sheets. \u201cEven though it doesn\u2019t seem like such a big deal, sleeping with makeup on, especially around the eyes, leads to low level chronic inflammation and irritation, which brings inflammatory molecules to your cells,\u201d explains Dr. Jessica Krant, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in New York. \u201cThese cause direct damage, breaking down the rubbery, plump extracellular matrix that gives our skin its bounce and glow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reuters)\n\nBoost Up the Collagen\nCollagen, the protein that helps skin remain its elasticity, is crucial for maintaining youthful, glowing features. However, skin loses its tone with age as collagen wears down, resulting in those unwanted fine lines. However, you can increase the collagen in your skin. \u201cTopical vitamin A products are useful because of the ability to increase collagen synthesis in the skin and also temper discoloration of the skin,\u201d says Dr. Julia Tzu, clinical assistant professor of dermatology at New York University School of Medicine. \u201cThe over the counter version is retinol. The more powerful prescription version is tretinoin or tazarotene. Your local dermatologist can help you decide which type of topical vitamin A is best for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thinkstock)\n\nDrink Plenty of Water\nAlways begin and end your day with cool, crisp water. But don't just stop there. Skip the sugary drinks and have water by your side at all times. Not only will it quench your thirst, but it will always keep your skin hydrated and supple. \u201cOnce you realize you\u2019re thirsty, you\u2019re already dehydrated, which takes its toll in your skin,\u201d says celebrity nutritionist JJ Virgin. \u201cAlways keep a canteen with purified water nearby to hydrate your cells so nutrients stay in and toxins get out. Proper hydration means you sweat more efficiently to keep your skin glowing and looking fabulous.\u201d Virgin recommends beginning your day with a glass of water to kick off healthier habits. As for cocktail hour? We\u2019re not saying to give it up completely, but do keep in mind that alcohol does dehydrate skin, so think twice before making it a double.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thinkstock)\n\nSlather On the SPF\nExperts say your 40s are the right time to start using retinol if you haven\u2019t begun already, but there is one product you should be slathering on every day, no matter your age. \u201cNow is the time to really step up the sun-protective strategies with at least SPF 30 every day and also a hat if you are spending any longer than 5-10 minutes in the sun,\u201d says Dr. Elizabeth Tanzi, co-director of the Washington Institute of Dermatologic Laser Surgery. \u201cThe effects of the sun are cumulative and so many women are running around with work, kids, and errands that they\u2019re spending a lot of time in direct sunlight without realizing it. The cumulative effect of all this sun ages the skin quickly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thinkstock)\n\nExfoliate\nIn addition to thoroughly cleansing your face every evening, it\u2019s just as important to implement exfoliation once a week to slough away dry, rough patches that emphasize wrinkles. \u00a0Just make sure to exfoliate gently, avoiding a red, irritated complexion that hurts to the touch. \u201cI think a great exfoliant is very underrated,\u201d says New York City-based celebrity facialist Joanna Vargas. \u201cWe call exfoliation our secret weapon at my salon because it can transform the skin completely in very little time. Exfoliation allows your products to penetrate better, it keeps the pores minimized, and it can erase fine lines caused by dehydration in the skin.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thinkstock)\n\nApply Eye Cream Religiously \nIn addition to sunscreen, experts say it\u2019s just as important to apply eye cream every night.

But at $49.00, it can be pretty pricey. Luckily, in the world of skincare, it is only a matter of time before someone will copy and tweak your formula and sell it at a much lower price. That\u2019s exactly what Alpha Hydrox did with its Retinol ResQ treatment. Here\u2019s how the two formulas compare:\nIngredient Analysis\n\nRetinol\nRetinol is an anti-aging superstar anyone should incorporate in their skincare routine, at least after they\u2019ve turned the big 3-0. One of the few ingredients that can really reduce fine lines and wrinkles, it can boost collagen production and firm skin. But there\u2019s a catch. Retinol can be irritating at first, causing redness, peeling, and a slight tingling sensation.\nThat\u2019s why, until your skin has gotten used to it, you should apply it only every other day or so. Then, slowly increase frequency. Both products, though, use a time-delivery technology, which reduces the risks of irritation. How? By simply releasing retinol slowly over a period of several hours rather than all at once.\n\nTocopheryl Acetate & Ascorbyl Palmitate\nTocopheryl Acetate is a form of Vitamin E. This vitamin is a wonderful moisturizer capable of strengthening the skin\u2019s natural barrier and thus slow down water loss. Because of its antioxidant properties, it can help prevent the signs of aging too.\nAscorbyl Glucoside is a stable form of Vitamin C. A powerful antioxidant, it helps fight free radicals and boost collagen production. It\u2019s therefore a strong ally in the fight against premature aging.\nThese antioxidants work even better when used together, as they enhance each other\u2019s effectiveness, and provide some additional protection from UV rays (but they should never be used as a substitute for sunscreen!).\n\nDimethicone\nDimethicone is a silicone widely used in skincare products for its ability to fill in fine lines and wrinkles, making them look less obvious. It also enhances the spreadability of a product, allowing an even application, and makes skin silky smooth to the touch.\nDimethicone gets a bad rep because it has been accused of suffocating skin, but that\u2019s simply not true. Silicones have a particular molecular structure, which is made of larger molecules with wider spaces between each molecule, that allows them to create a barrier that protects skin but still allows it to perspire.\n\nGlycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, C10 30 Cholesterol/Lanesterol Esters, & Cetyl Ricinoleate\nOne of the most commonly used ingredients in skincare, glycerin is a humectant that draws water from the environment into the skin, thus helping to keep it hydrated.\nCetearyl Alcohol is a fatty alcohol, ie a good type of alcohol that has emollient properties. Non-irritating, it helps to keep skin moisturized. Other emollients present in the formula are C10 30 Cholesterol/Lanesterol Esters, a blend of cholesterol and fatty acid ester from lanolin, and Cetyl Ricinoleate, a fatty acid made from castor oil. Together, these ingredients leave skin soft and smooth for hours.\nFurther considerations on the formula\nBoth Philosophy Help Me Retinol Night Treatment and Alpha Hydrox Retinol ResQ help prevent and reduce wrinkles (although I would have loved to see more antioxidants included in both formulas) and moisturize skin well. They are more suitable for normal to dry skin.\nPhilosophy Help Me Retinol Night Treatment Ingredients\nwater (aqua), caprylic/capric triglyceride, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, c10-30 cholesterol/lanosterol esters, cetyl alcohol, dimethicone, cetyl ricinoleate, polysorbate 60, benzyl alcohol, retinol, tocopheryl acetate, ascorbyl palmitate, methyl methacrylate/glycol dimethacrylate crosspolymer, stearic acid, peg-10 soy sterol, phenoxyethanol, cyclopentasiloxane, magnesium aluminum silicate, cyclohexasiloxane, methylparaben, triethanolamine, disodium edta, bisabolol, bht, polysorbate 20, propyl gallate, ascorbic acid.\nAlpha Hydrox Retinol ResQ Ingredients\nWater, Capric/Caprylic Stearic Triglyceride, Emulsifying Wax, Glycerin, C10 30 Cholesterol/Lanesterol Esters, Cetyl Ricinoleate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Benzyl Alcohol, Cyclomethicone, Retinol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Acrylates Crosspolymer, Bisabolol (L-Alpha), PEG 10 Soy Sterol, Magnesium Aluminium Silicate, Stearic Acid, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, BHT, Disodium EDTA, Propyl Gallate, Polysorbate 20, Triethanolamine\nAvaibility\nPackaged in a 1.05 oz tube, Philosophy Help Me Retinol Night Treatment Ingredients can be purchased at Sephora.

A state secret organization to maintain confidentiality of these incidents still works successfully on the concealment of this most important event in the history of mankind \".\n\"500 years ago, the astronomer Copernicus was condemned as a heretic because he claimed that the Earth was not the center of the universe. This is now obsolete. But these days, believes the majority of us still believe that mankind is the biological center of the universe. We will not accept so long that intelligent life exists beyond Earth, until we collide when shopping with an alien. \"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKlpxjOROPo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V4L5KguIhY&feature=youtu.be\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flESIK35Bn0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLATKLw8Cis&hc_location=ufi\nAccording to NASA\u2019S SPACE ACT since July 29, 1958, SECTION 1, \u00a72\nInformation obtained or developed by the administrator by it\u2019s function under this act\nshall be available\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/offices/ogc/about/space_act1.html#SHORT%20TITLE\nhttps://myspace.com/earthoptimization/video/ecbs-information-film-desk-stock/108029061\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSOqHfgCtgw\nhttp://misnic.com\nhttp://misnic.net/\nhttp://copyandpastewillhealtheworld.com/\nDR GREER 2 Billion USD offred to shut up!.....\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gVLv5eg4Xg&feature=share", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/237775506257376/posts/968517596516493", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": ":)\n\nDie Produkte aus dem Video:\n- Mixnature: https://www.mixnature.com/de/\n- Lieblingsprodukt: https://www.mixnature.com/de/face/face_scrub (ihr k\u00f6nnt eure eigenen Produkte zusammen stellen!)\n- Skin Ceuticals: http://goo.gl/e5eIof\n- Bebe Creme: http://goo.gl/6dIx7c\n- Benefit Take a Picture it lasts longer: http://goo.gl/8gW0gK\n- Ahava Body \u00d6l: http://goo.gl/QhtbZE\n-", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM7eYalOtXI", "lang": "de", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "support and like the whistleblowers clubhouse allda-bens sd_ecbs ceo site free internet is a human right!

He is handsome, strong, and completely terrifying. The star of his college\u2019s basketball team and now gone pro, he\u2019s more concerned with the dirt on his shoe than me.But I noticed him.I saw him. I heard him. The things that he did, and the deeds that he hid\u2026For years, I bit my nails, unable to look away.Now, I\u2019ve graduated high school and moved on to college, but I haven\u2019t stopped watching Michael.

The doors opened as soon as I pushed the button, and I stepped inside, trying to calm my racing heart.They still intimidated me.And excited me. And challenged me. And knotted me up.I\u2019d kind of wanted to go to a party but not with them.The doors started closing, but just then a hand shot into the elevator, and I jumped, seeing the doors re-open. I sucked in a breath, staring wide-eyed as Michael reached in, grabbed my shirt by the collar with one hand, and pulled me out.\u201cMichael!\u201d I shouted.I stumbled into him, and before I knew what was happening, he grabbed my wrists and locked them behind my back, walking into me and forcing me backward, back down the hall toward the kitchen.\u201cLet me go!\u201d I demanded, my lips brushing the tip of his chin.\u201cI don\u2019t know, guys,\u201d he teased over my head, \u201cshe still seems pretty fucking easy to push around. What do you think?\u201dLaughter greeted me as he forced me back into the living area.Every muscle in my body was on fire, and the tips of my toes kept getting caught under his sneakers.I twisted my body, trying to break his hold. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201dI pushed against his chest and jerked my body to the left, tearing out of his hold with every muscle I could muster.I stumbled, losing my balance, and fell backward, crashing to the floor. Pain shot through my ass, running down my legs as the fall knocked the wind out me.Shit!Shooting my hands behind me, I pushed myself up and bent my knees, looking up at him as he advanced.He stalked over and then stopped, towering over me. I immediately moved my hands and feet, crawling backward, away from him.But then I felt something at my back, and I halted. I twisted my head, seeing a dark pant leg, and I didn\u2019t know if it was Damon, Will, or Kai, but it didn\u2019t matter. I was closed in.Oh, no. I slowly raised my eyes, seeing Michael\u2019s lips tilt in a devious smile. I stopped breathing, seeing him lower his body to the floor, planting his knees between my bent legs, and his hands at my sides.My neck arched back as his face hovered over mine, but I tried to keep myself up as much as possible, no matter how close his body got.\u201cI thought you were one of us,\u201d his whispered, his breath caressing my lips. \u201cI thought you could play.\u201dI stilled, staring into his eyes.You\u2019re one of us now. Will had said that to me on that night so long ago.Michael\u2019s amber eyes searched mine and then dropped to my mouth, his breathing growing heavy as he stared at me like he was about to take a bite.I wanted to cry. What the hell was going on?Three years ago was nearly the happiest night of my life, and it quickly became the worst. And ever since then, Michael not only acted as if I didn\u2019t exist, but also, at times, as if he wished I didn\u2019t.Now the guys were free, and they were all back together again. What did I have to do with any of this? What did he want with me?\u201cI don\u2019t know this game,\u201d I told him, barely audible.He stared into my eyes, thinning his own as if studying me. \u201cAll you need to know,\u201d he finally answered, \u201cis that you can\u2019t tap out.\u201d\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u00a0About Penelope Douglas\u00a0\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Penelope Douglas is the New York Times, USA Today, and Wall St", "link": "http://www.abookishescape.com/2015/11/release-blitz-giveaway-corrupt-by.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "\"BookElves Anthology\" giveaways Mother Daughter Book Reviews  is pleased to be coordinating a Book Blast for the second volume of the \"BookElves Anthology\" featuring some of your favorite middle grade authors.

And unlike a lot of the dramatic Debbie\u2019s out there, I\u2019m not making a grand announcement via a status update on my personal account.\u00a0 No \u201cI\u2019m deleting my Facebook account\u201d. Nothing. I\u2019m just stepping back and shutting the doors. This post is the biggest proclamation that I\u2019ll make. And it\u2019s not Facebook that I\u2019m sick and tired of, it\u2019s the people of Facebook. I honestly just can\u2019t take the negativity, finger-pointing and shaking, tsk-tsking that has gotten worse and worse over the past couple of years. No one can think for themselves anymore.. they post things without a second thought of where it came from and how critical they sound. Case in point: the tragedy in Paris. People wanted to show their solidarity and what France was going thru. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s been 14 years, 9/11 still cuts most of us to the core when we remember it. Yet, when people started to change their profile pictures or share memories of why Paris meant something to them, instead of respecting it, people tore them a new asshole because \u201chow can you support Paris and not Kenya?\u201d When people wanted to share their pride in their family members who are Vets, people complained that the homeless Vets were being neglected. Friends \u2013 supporting one thing doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re shunning another.\u00a0In a time of our lives when the thing we need most is compassion, it\u2019s the last thing that you\u2019ll find on social media. What has happened to us, as a society, that makes us think that sitting behind a computer screen gives us the power of God to decide what one person should or should not think or do? As I sat and watched my niece perform with her Philharmonic group tonight, it hit me. It\u2019s time for a break from all of it. For the next month, no more updates. No more likes or shares. I\u2019m just done and my brain can use some much more intelligent banter and discussion than what I can find scrolling thru my Facebook feed. And have I mentioned how much of a time suck it is to scroll thru all that negativity?\u00a0 If you know me, then you know that I make my living off of social media \u2013 I\u2019m pretty damn good at it, too. So, how can I take a Face-cation and still do my job? Through the power of apps that will let me access my pages and groups\u2026 all without ever hitting my personal page. There are so many other things that I can do with my time\u2026 ALL of us for that matter. Read a book. Write a story. Take a walk. Connect with people eye to eye. Do more crafts with my girls\u2026 they\u2019re not going to be here much longer. So many other things that will fill my soul with happy moments \u2013 not the constant nastiness with the occasional funny meme thrown in for good measure. Maybe I\u2019ll comprise posts of what\u00a0would\u00a0have been a status update.. the random thoughts and funny things that pop in my head throughout the day\u2026 In closing\u2026 if you need or want to reach me and you usually do via Facebook messenger, don\u2019t. You can email me at kristen@fourhensandarooster, leave me a message on my Facebook page, hit me up on Twitter, or leave me a comment here on the site! Trust me, it\u2019s not you \u2013 it\u2019s them. I\u2019ll pop back on there on December 17th, which ironically is my birthday. It would be a GREAT birthday gift to see that things may have changed, but I highly doubt it. Have you ever just shut it all down or at least, taken a break?\nThis is a post from Four Hens and a Rooster Read the original post It\u2019s Time for a Face-Cation", "link": "http://fourhensandarooster.com/its-time-for-a-face-cation/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "#MISNICISM The native indians and us against the complex\n\nThe gods will rubbed Muslims off the planet if they don't stop thier uggly behavoir around the globe.

My nightmares, however, became my obsession.\nHis name is Michael Crist.\nMy boyfriend\u2019s older brother is like that scary movie that you peek through your hand to watch. He is handsome, strong, and completely terrifying. The star of his college\u2019s basketball team and now gone pro, he\u2019s more concerned with the dirt on his shoe than me.\nBut I noticed him.\nI saw him. I heard him. The things that he did, and the deeds that he hid\u2026For years, I bit my nails, unable to look away.\nNow, I\u2019ve graduated high school and moved on to college, but I haven\u2019t stopped watching Michael. He\u2019s bad, and the dirt I\u2019ve seen isn\u2019t content to stay in my head anymore.\nBecause he\u2019s finally noticed me.\nMichael\nHer name is Erika Fane, but everyone calls her Rika.\nMy brother\u2019s girlfriend grew up hanging around my house and is always at our dinner table. She looks down when I enter a room and stills when I am close. I can always feel the fear rolling off of her, and while I haven\u2019t had her body, I know that I have her mind. That\u2019s all I really want anyway.\nUntil my brother leaves for the military, and I find Rika alone at college.\nIn my city.\nUnprotected.\nThe opportunity is too good to be true as well as the timing. Because you see, three years ago she put a few of my high school friends in prison, and now they\u2019re out.\nWe\u2019ve waited. We\u2019ve been patient. And now every last one of her nightmares will come true.\nBuy Links \u2192 Amazon + Amazon UK + B&N + Kobo + iTunes\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Corrupt ~ Excerpt \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI fell back to my feet and crept through my apartment as I listened to the pounding that had now become a steady attack. My feet followed the sound, stepping absently closer to it, and I finally pressed my ear against the wall leading to my hallway, my heart racing as the vibrations touched my skin.\nResting my cheek against the surface, I swallowed the tight lump in my throat as the thumping against the wall grew faster and faster.\nThere was someone over there. In the empty apartment.\nHolding up my phone, I dialed the office downstairs but got no answer. I knew there was a night manager named Simon Something-Or-Other, but I didn\u2019t think many people were on duty at night. He must be away from his desk.\nI continued listening, wondering if I could ignore it and just wait until morning to ask the manager about it, but the further down the hall I travelled, the louder it got until I was standing next to the rear entrance.\nOpening up the door, I peeked my head into the hallway, holding the heavy steel exit open just enough to inspect.\nGlancing to my right, I saw a door just like mine. And then I heard a woman\u2019s high-pitched cry ring out around me, and I started breathing harder.\nAnd then there was another cry. And another, and another, and\u2026\nWas she having sex? My mouth fell open as I tried not to laugh.\nOh, my God.\nBut I thought the place was supposed to be empty.\nI stepped out, knife in hand\u2014just in case\u2014and walked quietly down to the other door, glancing up and seeing small security cameras along the wall, probably installed when the apartments were built.\nPressing my ear to the door, I listened, still hearing the thump, thump, thump of something hitting the wall, and the girl\u2019s breathy cries over and over again.\nI folded my lips between my teeth, covering my smile with my free hand.\nBut then the woman cried out. \u201cNo! Ah, oh, God! Please!\u201d\nAnd my face fell, hearing the fear in her voice. The short, shrill screams were now different. Panicked and scared, and her cries sounded struggled. My mouth suddenly went dry as I stood there listening.\n\u201cAh!\u201d she cried out again. \u201cNo, please stop!\u201d\nI backed away from the door, not finding it funny anymore.\nBut then something hit the door from the other side, making a loud thud, and I scurried backward. \u201cOh, shit,\u201d I gritted out under my breath.\nI shot my head up to the cameras, now wondering if they fed to Security downstairs or to whoever was inside the apartment. Did they know I was out here?\nI spun around and dashed for my door, grabbing the handle and trying to twist it.\nBut it was locked. \u201cDammit!\u201d I mouthed. Fucking thing must lock automatically.\nAnother thud hit the door, mere feet away from me\u2014so close\u2014and I darted my eyes over to it, my breathing turning fast and painful.\nI pulled on the door handle again, twisting and yanking, but it didn\u2019t budge.\nAnother thud hit the door, and I jerked upright, dropping the knife.\n\u201cShit.\u201d\nI dived down to pick it up, but just then I heard the other door swing open, so I bolted down the stairwell, hiding behind the wall and forgetting about the knife.\nFuck!\nScrew this. Whoever was coming out of the vacant apartment was definitely someone I didn\u2019t want to meet.

Oops! One craft crashed at Roswell. The other crashed about 135 miles to the east at Socorro, NM. There is controversy as to whether or not there was one survivor, a Grey said to be nicknamed Skinny Bob, who lived secretly at Area 51 until he died in 1952.\n\nBelieve it or not, Lacerta is a Reptoid and was interviewed for two hours on this YouTube Video. Recommend viewing entire video for amazing narrated testimony about Reptoids living deep beneath the surface of the Earth. Section regarding Roswell Crash is at about 1:42 hours into video.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeWg_qSddeE\n\nTHIS IS THE INFORMATON DESK OF THE SD_ECBS NEWSAGENCY OF THE INSTANT ENLIGHTENMENT INFORMING MACHINE PROGRAM WE LOST ONLY DATA FOR ABOUT 1,180,000\u20ac DURING NOVEMBER 2014 by supporting the STEVE BASSETT UFO/ET/SPACEGODS-DISCLOSURE-CAMPAIGN on the CIA SOCIAL NETWORK called FACEBOOK.\nThe work of the United Artists for Earthoptimization (UAFE) is nonprofit.\nIf you w", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/237775506257376/posts/918894151478838", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "***ATTENTION*** Hit LIKE if you see this!\nJust a reminder - I NEVER send out friend request.

The grind of stone on stone touches my dormant ears, and soft candlelight peeks through the slightest of crevices above me, warming my cold face. Bones creaking, my body shifts gently to the side, twisting through darkness, as the rich aroma of melted wax wafts over me. The sweet tinge of vanilla candles. There must be hundreds just beyond my tomb. I wonder who put them there, how they stay lit.The spiciness of gardenia petals flits through my resting place, too, sharp and intoxicating as ever. They are perfectly pristine flowers, I remember, yet so delicate\u2014they bruise too easily.The soft, protective embrace of feathered wings catches my weakened sight through the widening rift overhead, protecting me in shimmering cream and gold plumage. I don't know how long I've been here, buried underneath this heavy slab in the frigid cold of The City of The Dead, but I know MacCoinnich is near me. I feel his heat emanate through the stone, the warmth of his undying love, even in death, fills me with hope in the dark. I remember us. I remember him. All the time in the world could not make me forget.

Shop for a party dress, or decide on a recipe to bring to Friendsgiving? Find a way to eke a solid yes or no from your most elusive guests, or just go ahead and assume they're coming (while quietly fuming) so food is aplenty?\nI won't pretend to be good at sussing out priorities (or responding in a timely manner to my friends' invitations), but I can think of one task that's never too soon to get started on, and that's tidying. Worry about all the details of the party later\u2014for now, it's time to get your house organized. Here are some ways to spare yourself a breakdown later, before the true madness of Thanksgiving prep sets in:\nClean any silver you'd like to use.\nOur large-batch (and all-natural!) method for silver utensils will get them shiny without any tedious scrubbing\u2014and uses just one pantry item and one common kitchen supply staple so that chemistry does all the work for you.\n rss Replenish your cleaning supplies.\nWhether by making your own all-natural cleaners or by stocking up on your favorite brands, you'll need something to scour with.\n rss Deep clean the kitchen!\nWith our cleverest kitchen cleaning tricks, banishing sticky grime and getting your grout white is a cinch. Then when you start to prep (and when you tackle clean-up), you'll be that much closer to a spotless surface.\nSharpen your knives.\nYou'll be very glad you did this now come turkey time\u2014and here's how.\n rss Tend to the bar cart situation.\nLater, you might consider making a batch specialty cocktail for your event (even caterers recommend doing this!), but for now just be sure the bar cart has all the necessary basics.\nConsider your storage supplies.\nHopefully you'll have enough time to do some cooking in advance, and as soon as you chop that first carrot for the next day's mise you're going to need a place to store it. Get icky smells out of your favorite plastic storage containers with these genius methods\u2014or upgrade to something classier (we love these glass storage containers.).\n rss Be sure you've got enough plates for everyone.\nWe've got a couple of good ideas if you're short:\n\nCompostable disposables will make cleanup a thing of (impossibly-easy) beauty.\nOur brand new Hawkins dinnerware line is fancy enough for a party but made to handle everyday use.\nFeeling especially low-key? Roll out a sheath of kraft paper to eat off of like Leslie and then toss it when you're all done eating.\n\n\n rss Do a platter check.\nA drumstick might do fine on a paper plate, but a whole bird is another story. You're going to want big bowls for the sides (creamed spinach is way less fun when seeping over the edge of a plate) and serving platters for anything heftier.\nShop serving pieces here!\n rss Be sure you have enough seating.\nYou can always rent (or, let's be real here, borrow) chairs to make room\u2014but if you like having people over it's a good idea to spring for some collapsible ones\u2014how great is this waxed canvas one?\nIn the event that you do stock up, find a place to hang them out of the way until the big day; in the office, we use dowels to make quick work of this.\n rss Consider the bathrooms.\nNo matter how you try to prevent it, your guests will find their way into every room in your home, and they will open all the cabinets and drawers that you hope they do not open. Prepare: Stock some cute soaps, put helpful and pretty things on a little shelf, and don't forget to put out matches and candles.\n rss What are we forgetting?

This is not refuge.\nMore importantly, the family would immediately be identifiable as foreigners on welfare system with free housing. What a stigma!\nKeith Ross, New Westminster\nWhat a nanny state\nRe: Michael Smyth\u2019s Nov. 29 column about booze being sold in grocery stores.\nI live in Thrums, halfway between Castlegar and Nelson. For years, I\u2019ve been able to buy wine, beer and liquor at four gas-station convenience stores, all located within a 15-minute drive from my home. I must laugh at how social life has been disturbed in so many ways by government in larger B.C. communities.\nYou can walk down the street in New Orleans, Rome or Las Vegas holding a drink.

Got in contact with Rafael from Mexico concerning UFO-research. I built up a strong international network during my 2007, 2012 Obama-support and switched over to new tasks like UFODISCLOSURE, D\u00e4nikens Spacegods-research...after that. So I started with the UFO discussion as a nobody. I met Carol Rosin and the war in space material of Christopher Everard and his Enigma Channel, met Rebecca & Dan Willis, Brien Foerster Ancient Aliens H2, found the NASA Space act of 1958, found the Ufo on the moon official server pic, Apollo 20 discussion, found pyramides on the moon discussion is a hoax....Who is behind the destruction of the Larry hatch UFO-database... So I grounded a nonprofit newsagency called SD_ECBS with friends after the shocking discovery of the NONINFORMATIONCAMPAIGNS and out of our experiences of the OBAMASUPPORT not the writing of a post is the work but the postings. So reason why this is big as facebook made it is possible. Need time but need more time to find that all at all.

Today we fly helicopters or jets and drive cars with a tremendous speed, while talking with on mobile phones and switched the cd-player while driving the car.............

With all of the internet sites for scrapbooking and documenting events, I have found it harder and harder to find actual books to record the information for my little ones. I still prefer the hands on experience and was super excited to get this treasure for our upcoming baby.There is nothing like my kids sitting and holding their baby books and thumbing through them. I still have mine and just love it! So much more meaningful than booting up the computer and browsing through photos. I love that I can share my thoughts at the moment and record them in my own handwriting. The beautiful illustrations by Angela Hicks give you that soft, sweet baby feel to the book! There are places for photos as well as areas to write down specific events and traits for your little one.The book has a soft covered hardback that will last for generations to come. It records from birth to 5 years. I think this is the perfect amount of time. I tend to get a couple years in, and then forget about it. \u00a0ISBN 9781841356006, Paperback, Full color throughout, 26 Pages, 11.5 X 10, $16.95Visit Parkwest Publications for other great products on these social media sites: https://twitter.com/Parkwestpubs. \u00a0https://www.facebook.com/pages/Parkwest-Publications/216114391814447Don't miss a single post Subscribe to A Year of Jubilee Reviews and get our latest reviews and giveaways directly  to your inbox!

they did have stolen a lot of performace on the social networks especially myspace.\n\nas written in the atlantic wire (link below)\nthe united nations counts internet access as a basic human right in a report that bears implications both to on-going events in the arab spring and to the obama administration's war on whistleblowers. acting as special rapporteur, a human rights watchdog role appointed by the un secretary general, frank la rue takes a hard line on the importance of the internet as \"an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights, combating inequality, and accelerating development and human progress.\" presented to the general assembly on friday, la rue's report comes as the capstone of a year's worth of meetings held between la rue and local human rights organizations around the world, from cairo to bangkok. the report's introduction points to the impact of online collaboration in the arab spring and says that \"facilitating access to the internet for all individuals, with as little restriction to online content as possible, should be a priority for all states.\"\n\nthe un report overwhelmingly supports the internet as a communication platform, a boon to all democratic societies, but it also warns how the internet's unique architecture threatens power brokers in those societies:\n\nthe vast potential and benefits of the internet are rooted in its unique characteristics, such as its speed, worldwide reach and relative anonymity. at the same time, these distinctive features of the internet that enable individuals to disseminate information in \"real time\" and to mobilize people has also created fear amongst governments and the powerful. this has led to increased restrictions on the internet through the use of increasingly sophisticated technologies to block content, monitor and identify activists and critics, criminalization of legitimate expression, and adoption of restrictive legislation to justify such measures.

Within walking distance of the Magic Kingdom and offering one of the best breakfast buffets at Disney World, The Wave is also a fantastic place to get a drink \u00a0with your significant other, or better yet, on your next monorail bar crawl. For our recommendation it was a battle between two drinks we absolutely adore. We first leaned towards The Wavesicle, which was like drinking an orange creamsicle mixed with vodka. Wait, there is something better than that?! Yes, and it is called the Under the Florida Moon. Think of it as a Mimosa topped with a beer, except even better. The combination of citrus flavors is smooth, light, and refreshing while not being overly acidic.\nRun, don\u2019t walk, to the real best kept secret at Disney, The Wave\u2026 of American Flavors.\nIngredients:\u00a04 Orange Vodka, St \u2013 Germain Liqueur, Agave Nectar, and Orange Juice topped with Blue Moon.\nUnder the Florida Moon.

My mother and my music. Mama was taken from me too soon, and now music is all I have left. It\u2019s the thing that\u2019s pushed me right out of backwoods Georgia into Los Angeles, where the line between fantasy and reality shimmers and blurs. I\u2019m finally making my way, making my mark. I can\u2019t afford to fall for one of music's brightest stars. Not now. Music is all I have left, and I\u2019m holding on tight with both hands. I won\u2019t let go, not even for Rhyson Gray.RHYSONI had one thing in my life that mattered \u2013 music. The only constant, it\u2019s taken me to heights most people only dream about; a gift dropped in my lap at birth. I thought it was enough. I thought it was everything until I met Kai. Now she\u2019s all I think about, like a song I can't get out of my head. If I have to chase her, if I have to give up everything - I will. And once she's mine, I won't let go.Goodreads\u00a0 Excerpt\u00a0I shouldn\u2019t have come. All the things I felt and fought, the things I suspected he felt too, he just spewed all over me. And as much as I want to be, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ll never forget seeing my Mama in bed for days after Daddy left. And even though she got up, I suspect a part of her never left that bed, but just stayed there, waiting. We had to leave the house where she grew up and where I spent my first years, because Daddy left us with nowhere to go. Mama learned to stand on her two feet, and I\u2019ve done the same. I just didn\u2019t count on Rhyson sweeping me off of them.\u201cWe\u2019re obviously on different pages about this.\u201d I pull my hands free and turn to leave, but he steps in front of me, blocking my grand exit. \u201cLet\u2019s talk later.\u201d\u201cEnough talking.\u201dThe heat of his body grabs me before his hands do. He traps my chin between two fingers, taking my mouth in a paradox of rough and tender. I want to move. To slide away from his body pressing me into the pool table. But I can\u2019t. Not with his hand caressing my back. Not with his tongue in my mouth. Not with his erection pressing into my stomach. I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t. I have been denying myself this, and I\u2019m so damn hungry. My mouth opens under his, ravenous and wet and hot. His groan vibrates against my lips.\u201cYes. Good God, yes, Pep.\u201d His words slip down my throat.I strain up on tiptoes, clawing my fingers into his dark hair, forcing him closer. He lifts me onto the pool table, planting himself between my knees. His fingers skim my bare thigh, working up my leg until he reaches a damp patch of silk. He pushes my panties aside, rubbing his hand into the wet flesh there before sliding one long finger and then another inside of me. I rock into these fingers which have awed millions with their skill. They own me. I\u2019m the instrument in his hands. He\u2019s playing me. Plucking at me. Strumming me.He tugs at the wide neck of my sweater until it falls away from my shoulder, slipping his hand in and cupping my naked breast. He brushes his fingers over my nipple, and I lose my mind and every inhibition. My head flops back and I stretch my legs wider, offering him anything he wants.\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d His question burns the vulnerable curve of my neck as he drags his lips to my shoulder. \u201cYou come here wearing no bra and think I won\u2019t\u2026\u201dHe abandons the words, his dark, untidy head disappearing under my sweater, and before I have time to regain even millimeters of sanity, my nipple is in his mouth and he\u2019s suckling me. Not gentle. Not soft. My breasts are so small, he almost eats me whole. Every draw, every suck, every bite sends a power surge to my core until my knees hold his hips in a desperate grip, and my nails rake across the flat surface of the pool table behind me.His mouth at my breast. His fingers inside me. His clean scent surrounding me. I have nowhere to hide anymore. I am exposed. I want to spread myself wide open for him. That voice that has been telling me I can\u2019t rely on him. I can\u2019t trust him. I can\u2019t <em>need</em> him\u2014that voice is stunned into silence by his thorough possession of my body, by the inferno between my legs, blazing a hole right through my soul and scorching my heart. WiLoveBooks ReviewKai and Rhyson are drawn together from the moment they meet. Kai wants to perform and wants to do it on her own. She doesn't want to get involved with Rhyson because he's a big star and she doesn't want to lose herself. He agrees to just be friends and I admired how long he went along with that. They have a chance to really get to know one another. I really liked both characters. I liked how the point of view alternated between them because you could really see where each was coming from. I was frustrated by the ending and the fact that I have to wait for the next book. This one has all the feels. Couldn't put it down.My Rating: *****Steam Factor: !!!!*Notes:\u00a0LanguageBuy Links\u00a0  \u00a0 Giveawaya Rafflecopter giveaway Pla", "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/RYmNjX/~3/dVyTGjvpzd4/my-soul-to-keep-by-kennedy-ryan-release.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "SOCIAL POISONING WITH PLASTICS (Open all links) GUESS WHAT?

Lucky Magazine is no more?! That was the very first fashion magazine I fell in love with. I was in high school and bought a subscription every year. I would hoard each issue vowing that I would be as stylish as the models on the pages one day. Although I couldn't afford any of the clothes then (and even now), Lucky taught me how to have an eye for spotting both trendy and classic wardrobe pieces no matter what store I visited.I'm so sad to hear it's the end of the road for all those in the Lucky family, but I would like to sincerely thank each and every one of you for the things you taught me in my early beginnings with fashion.And what's up at the Teen Vogue offices? Are decrease in sales the reason for the publication to merge with its older sister Vogue? Could this be the end of teen fashion magazines? I mean, what else is out there for them?

HAPPY RELEASE DAY: MY SOUL TO KEEP BY KENNEDY RYANSynopsisIt seems the things worth keeping are often the hardest to hold\u2026KAII had two things in life that mattered. My mother and my music.Mama\n was taken from me too soon, and now music is all I have left. It\u2019s the \nthing that\u2019s pushed me right out of backwoods Georgia into Los Angeles, \nwhere the line between fantasy and reality shimmers and blurs. I\u2019m \nfinally making my way, making my mark. I can\u2019t afford to fall for one of\n music\u2019s brightest stars. Not now. Music is all I have left, and I\u2019m \nholding on tight with both hands. I won\u2019t let go, not even for Rhyson \nGray.RHYSONI\n had one thing in my life that mattered \u2013 music. The only constant, it\u2019s\n taken me to heights most people only dream about; a gift dropped in my \nlap at birth. I thought it was enough. I thought it was everything until\n I met Kai. Now she\u2019s all I think about, like a song I can\u2019t get out of \nmy head. If I have to chase her, if I have to give up everything - I \nwill. And once she\u2019s mine, I won\u2019t let go.GoodreadsMy Goodreads Review for MY Soul to KeepExcerptI\n shouldn\u2019t have come. All the things I felt and fought, the things I \nsuspected he felt too, he just spewed all over me. And as much as I want\n to be, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ll never forget seeing my Mama in bed \nfor days after Daddy left. And even though she got up, I suspect a part \nof her never left that bed, but just stayed there, waiting. We had to \nleave the house where she grew up and where I spent my first years, \nbecause Daddy left us with nowhere to go. Mama learned to stand on her \ntwo feet, and I\u2019ve done the same. I just didn\u2019t count on Rhyson sweeping\n me off of them.\u201cWe\u2019re\n obviously on different pages about this.\u201d I pull my hands free and turn\n to leave, but he steps in front of me, blocking my grand exit. \u201cLet\u2019s \ntalk later.\u201d\u201cEnough talking.\u201dThe\n heat of his body grabs me before his hands do. He traps my chin between\n two fingers, taking my mouth in a paradox of rough and tender. I want \nto move. To slide away from his body pressing me into the pool table. \nBut I can\u2019t. Not with his hand caressing my back. Not with his tongue in\n my mouth. Not with his erection pressing into my stomach. I can\u2019t. I \nwon\u2019t. I have been denying myself this, and I\u2019m so damn hungry. My mouth\n opens under his, ravenous and wet and hot. His groan vibrates against \nmy lips.\u201cYes. Good God, yes, Pep.\u201d His words slip down my throat.I\n strain up on tiptoes, clawing my fingers into his dark hair, forcing \nhim closer. He lifts me onto the pool table, planting himself between my\n knees. His fingers skim my bare thigh, working up my leg until he \nreaches a damp patch of silk. He pushes my panties aside, rubbing his \nhand into the wet flesh there before sliding one long finger and then \nanother inside of me. I rock into these fingers which have awed millions\n with their skill. They own me. I\u2019m the instrument in his hands. He\u2019s \nplaying me. Plucking at me. Strumming me.He\n tugs at the wide neck of my sweater until it falls away from my \nshoulder, slipping his hand in and cupping my naked breast. He brushes \nhis fingers over my nipple, and I lose my mind and every inhibition. My \nhead flops back and I stretch my legs wider, offering him anything he \nwants.\u201cAre\n you kidding me?\u201d His question burns the vulnerable curve of my neck as \nhe drags his lips to my shoulder. \u201cYou come here wearing no bra and \nthink I won\u2019t\u2026\u201dHe\n abandons the words, his dark, untidy head disappearing under my \nsweater, and before I have time to regain even millimeters of sanity, my\n nipple is in his mouth and he\u2019s suckling me. Not gentle. Not soft. My \nbreasts are so small, he almost eats me whole. Every draw, every suck, \nevery bite sends a power surge to my core until my knees hold his hips \nin a desperate grip, and my nails rake across the flat surface of the \npool table behind me.His\n mouth at my breast. His fingers inside me. His clean scent surrounding \nme. I have nowhere to hide anymore. I am exposed. I want to spread \nmyself wide open for him. That voice that has been telling me I can\u2019t \nrely on him. I can\u2019t trust him. I can\u2019t need him\u2014that voice is \nstunned into silence by his thorough possession of my body, by the \ninferno between my legs, blazing a hole right through my soul and \nscorching my heart.About Kennedy RyanI\n just can\u2019t write about myself in third person for one more bio! I\u2019m a \nwife, a mom, a writer, an advocate for families living with autism. \nThat\u2019s me in a nutshell. Crack the nut, and you\u2019ll find a Southern girl \ngone Southern California who loves pizza and Diet Coke, and wishes she \ngot to watch a lot more television.

\nLove Revolution had a bit too much drama for my taste, even if I enjoyed the characters and the overall story just fine.\nMy Love Revolution review:\nSo, a bit much drama made Love Revolution less enjoyable to me, and so did the fact that we followed two couples instead of one. This made me feel like I didn\u2019t have enough time with either couple, and thus, I didn\u2019t really get to know the characters as well as I would have liked. What little I did to see of Sarah made her seem very controlling, both of her environment (and the people around her) in general, and also over her little sister, Samantha. Luckily, I got to know why she acted like this pretty soon, so I could understand where she was coming from, even if I didn\u2019t necessarily agree with her actions.\nGetting back to the universe of Brutal Strength was enjoyable, even if Love Revolution failed to woo me as much as it could have. I mean, what\u2019s not to love? Hot musicians, a fast-paced storyline, deception, deceit and drama. There was love, too, but maybe not quite enough for me to feel completely invested in these two couples.\nWritten in third person point of view, past tense, there are chapters from each of the four main characters\u2019 perspective. The voice of each characters is distinct, so it\u2019s really no problem following them. But if the story had been a bit longer, I would have gotten to know them better, and then I would also probably have enjoyed Love Revolution even more.\nSome of my favorite Love Revolution quotes:\nSara Daniels walked offstage after the encore, taking the chilled bottled water and a hand towel from her manager\u2019s outstretched hands.

Thanks for dropping by at Yettezkie's Doodles.com! Your ultimate source for your daily and/or weekly dose of beauty, fashion, and geekyness, all rolled up in one. Just enough to satisfy your usual cravings.\nFor more posts regarding beauty, makeup and more, please don't hesitate to visit http://www.yettezkiedoodle.com! \u2665 u!\nWhile everyone on the internet is practically discussing and debating about what\u2019s the real color of #thedress, I thought instead of confusing myself, I should just resume blogging. Anyway, I know that this is way delayed, for those of you who are also sick of the dress debate (like moi) then come join me and let\u2019s just talk about makeup. Shall we? \n  \n Today, I\u2019ll be reviewing the Wet \u2018N\u2019 Wild Color Icon Blush in \u2018Pearlescent Pink\u2019. This is actually my first Wet \u2018N\u2019 Wild blush. I\u2019ve owned their highlighters, bronzers, eyeshadow palettes and lip products but I don\u2019t have any of their blushes. I don\u2019t know why really. I\u2019ve heard tons of great things about their blushes, so I\u2019m definitely excited to put mine to the test. \n  Product Details/Claims according to WNW Beauty  \nSweep on this silky-smooth blush that strikes the perfect balance between a blendable transparent sheen and a radiant pop of maximum color. A special blend of treated nylon powders provides long-lasting color. Dermatologist-tested.  \n  \n\nPACKAGING\n\n \n Similar to other Wet \u2018N\u2019 Wild face products, their blushes are just housed in a plast packaging with a clear lid, and a slot for the brushes. And yes, the packaging, does feel cheap and flimsy so you will need to take care of it if in case you take this for traveling. It can also acquire a lot of scratches over time even if it\u2019s just in your storage. This is also something that I forgot to mention in my previous review regarding The Naked Truth eyeshadow palette. The blush brush is okay. You can definitely use it if you\u2019re traveling and you want to fit everything in a small pouch. \n  \n\nSHADE & APPLICATION\n\n \n Pearlescent Pink is a beautiful warm pink shade with tiny specs of silver in it. I actually thought that the blush can be really intense since WnW products are known for their extreme color payoff. But when I lightly tapped my brush onto the pan and applied it on to my cheeks, It wasn\u2019t as vibrant as I expected, which is not exactly a bad thing because overly pigmented blushes are not really good for beginners. Nevertheless, the blush is still very buildable and very easy to apply/blend.  \n  \n\nTEXTURE & PIGMENTATION\n\n \n Similar to WnW eyeshadows, this blush also very soft and creamy to the touch. This one also has a nice pigmentation and a decent color payoff. Though like I said previously, it may not have an extreme color payoff, it\u2019s exactly what I prefer personally. That way, you won\u2019t have to really be cautious in applying & blending your blush specially if you\u2019re in a hurry. #clowncheeks What I also like about this blush is that it\u2019s not powdery, nor does it look cakey when applied. It doesn\u2019t give me any fall outs so it leaves the packaging clean after every use.  \n  \n\nLONGEVITY\n\n  \nThis blush lasted on me for more than 4-5 hours depending on where I am. I\u2019ve used this outside while running and so far it lasted for the entire day. Though it might\u2019ve faded a bit since I sweat like crazy, mind you. I also tested this while I was at home, and it lasted me for nearly 5 hours. By then it started to fade.  \n  \n\nSCENT, ETC.\n\n  \nSimilar to their eyeshadow palettes, Wet \u2018N\u2019 Wild Color Icon blushes don\u2019t really have any particular scent. So if you\u2019re not in to scented makeups, you might want to try these out.  \n  \n\nTO SUMMARIZE\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u2022 PROS \u2022\n\n\n\u2022 NEUTRAL/CONS \u2022\n\n\n\n\n Comes with an applicator \n Pigmented \n Has a nice color payoff \n Applies/blends easily \n Buildable \n Creamy & soft to the touch \n Not powdery/chalky \n No fall outs \n Lasts 4-5 hours \n No particular scent \n Available online & locally \n Affordable\n\n\n No mirror included \n Cheap & flimsy packaging\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 THE VERDICT \u2022\n\n\n\n  \nI really like this blush because it\u2019s suitable for day to day use. It gives me the right amount of glow that I need and I can freely skip applying a highlighter if I want to. \n\n\n\n\n\u2022 WORTH THE MONEY\u2022\n\n\n\n\nYES  \nFor Php 287, I think yes. It may not be the cheapest drugstore brand but for the quality of the product itself I think it\u2019s definitely worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 REPURCHASE? \u2022\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps a different shade. \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\u2022 PRODUCT BASICS \u2022 \n\u2022 Product Name | Wet \u2018N\u2019 Wild Color Icon Blush \n \u2022 Shade | Pearlescent Pink \u2022 Price | Php 287 \u2022 Contains | 0.14 oz / 4.0 g \n \u2022 Availability | Luxola\n\n\n\n  \n So those are my thoughts regarding the Wet \u2018N\u2019 Wild Color Icon Blush in \u2018Pearlescent Pink\u2019.

Smith \nTreasure by S. Smith\nIt\u2019s 2077. There\u2019s no apocalypse,(What no Zombies roaming the earth) but some things are different. Things like the weather, the internet, and food. In twelve-year-old Clare\u2019s world, blueberry is just a flavor and apples are found only in fairy tales.\nOne day Clare meets Ana, who teaches her about seeds and real food, despite suspicions that such actions are illegal.\nWhen the authorities discover the children\u2019s forbidden tomato plant and arrest their mother, Clare and her brother flee. Clare has heard of a place called \u201cThe Garden State,\u201d and with their bikes, a little money, and backpacks, the children begin a lonely cross-country journey that tests them both physically and spiritually.\n\nWill they succeed in their quest to find a place of food freedom? And can they, only children, help change the world?\n=========================================================================================\nREVIEW\nThe premise of this book is interesting. I\u2019ve read quite a few \u201cfuturistic type books. This one while not necessarily being all that Dystopian, it\u2019s still not a pretty picture of our future.\nI do find it a little strange that the children have no idea what fruit and veggies are or that they actually exist or meat for that matter.So there must be more to the story. Maybe all food references to food have been erased from books or what would be old movies.\nYou see people only eat processed food squares now.Their food groups are Protein, Sweeties, Vitees, Carbos, and Snacks. As far as they know you get them at the STORE.They have no idea where the \u201cFood\u201d originates.\nBUT!!! as far as the writing and story itself it looks like the start of a pretty good series.I\u2019m not sure how many books will be in the series but it should be fun following the \u201cKIDS\u201d adventure.\nThe characters are well written and its fun to see them off on their great adventure in their search for the truth.Having the main characters kids will make it even more interesting to middle grade readers. Its always cool to see the children as the heroes of a novel. How they can overcome all the assorted obstacles that stand in the way,and think on their own.\n.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmazon * Barnes and Noble\n* KOBO\n * Smashwords * iTunes \nExcerpt\nBefore dark, the children had stuffed their backpacks with Ana\u2019s cherished books, extra clothing, and all the food and money they could find. They waited until midnight to slip out of the apartment and onto their bikes. Not trusting the city bus station, they decided to ride to the next town. \u00a0 Clare remembered which way Mama had driven when they left town to camp or swim. They didn\u2019t get out of the city much, but when they did, it was always memorable. She had no idea how long it would take to reach the edge of town, only that it was a long way.\n\u00a0It seemed like forever when they finally hit the place where the lights ended. A two-lane highway stretched ahead of them into the ebony night. They pedaled on. At last Dante\u2019s small voice broke the silence. \u201cClare? Clare, can we stop? I\u2019m tired.\u201d She kept riding, considering his request, and then eased to a stop. \u00a0 \u201cI guess we can stop and rest,\u201d she said. She shined her small flashlight around. Deep ditches, dry now, with long, bent-over grass lined both sides of the road. \u201cLet\u2019s get in the ditch; no one can see us there, and maybe we can sleep.\u201d As they nestled into the trench, Clare and Dante looked up for the first time, stunned at what they saw. They had never witnessed the expanse of the starry night sky quite like this. Away from the city lights and late into the summer night, the constellations lay before them like sand on the seashore. Dante caught his breath and opened his arms in a wide embrace.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nPraise for Seed Savers\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been this in love with an individual young adult book since Lois Lowry\u2019s The Giver\u2026 221 pages of exciting young adult goodness! I devoured it, and it was delicious.\u201d -Anakalian Whims Book Blog\n\u201cHere\u2019s a great piece of \u201cjuvenile\u201d literature that doesn\u2019t lose sight of one key fact: kids can think.\u201d- Lit Prof, Amazon Reviewer\n\u201cI highly recommend this book for tweens and teens who enjoy reading the dystopian genre and who are looking for a non-violent and thought-provoking story.\u201d \u2013 Renee at Mother Daughter Book Reviews\n\nAuthor S.

Leaving a sold-out show in Phoenix, he rents a car and drives north and east, landing in the Painted Desert town of Rainbow Rock.Nearly three years after leaving her old life behind, Lottie Beale is feeding people and baking pies, managing the Kachina Caf\u00e9 and tending secrets of her own. When circumstances conspire to give two attractive people some time alone together amid the world-class vistas of the Four Corners, they discover more than either had bargained for.PurchaseAmazon / Barnes & NobleExcerpt\u201cRo-man! Ro-man!\u201d A capacity crowd in the Ak-Chin Pavilion chanted his name under the starry desert sky, but Roman Kincaid barely heard it. He stood in the stage wings, gearing up for an encore and wondering when his dream had become a nightmare.\u201cOkay, guys,\u201d he said to his back-up band via their ear buds. \u201cOne encore only. Let\u2019s do \u2018Gamble.\u2019 Start with the chorus.\u201d He took two steps toward the stage entrance, swinging his guitar into playing position.Sam, his manager, caught his elbow. \u201cAre you sure about this? That crowd adores you. You could probably play three encores, sell more CDs\u2014\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Roman left no room for argument. \u201cOne and done. And no backstage stuff, either. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d He took a deep breath, pasted on the same fake, crowd-pleasing smile he\u2019d used in the last half-dozen shows, and jogged back onto the stage to the roar of twenty thousand excited voices. He strummed the intro and launched into the chorus of his first number-one hit:\u201cLove is such a gamble.You break a new deck every time.Sometimes you\u2019re dealt the aces;Others you draw to nines.But when I met you, I knew it was true.A winning hand you seemed.Now I have the rush of a royal flush.You are the gamble of my dreams.\u201dThe crowd cheered wildly as he played his way through the music he now sang in his sleep. In fact, he realized as he watched fans taking up the beat and clapping along, that was pretty much what he was doing now. He struggled to suppress a yawn during the guitar interlude as he turned to acknowledge his band.I spent my early life dreaming of a crowd like this. When did performing start to feel like a chore? He put the thought away. Lately he\u2019d been thinking of times when he\u2019d heard of some celebrity being hospitalized for exhaustion and assumed it was a euphemism for drug rehab. Now he wondered. When was the last time I felt truly rested? The question was an imponderable. Months, at least.He hit the last chord and took a deep bow, then shouted, \u201cThank you, Phoenix!\u201d and dashed off-stage.About the AuthorSusan Aylworth started her first book when she was nine. \u201cIt was called Buff, The Proud Stallion. I wrote eight whole pages.\u201d For her fifth grade career day, she stated her ambition to become \u201ca rich and famous author.\u201d Decades later, she is pleased to have achieved the \u2018author\u2019 part of that goal. A former university professor, she enjoys researching backgrounds and careers for her novels. \u201cIt\u2019s one way to live many lives at once.\u201d She lives in northern California with her husband of 45 years and two spoiled cats.Author Links:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GiveawayBook Blast Giveaway \u2013 $50 Amazon Gift Card or $50 in Paypal CashEnds 12/11/15Open only to those who can legally enter, receive and use an Amazon.com Gift Code or Paypal Cash.

(note: i could not find this at the allegan grocery store. sour cream (reg) worked just fine!\n1/2 cup of whole milk (this cake has like 8 sticks of butter. keep with the whole milk)\n1/2 cup of strong brewed coffee (this is what makes the cake in my opinion)\n1 cup of heavy cream whipped into thick peaks and kept cold\nfor the filling\n1 cup of light brown sugar packed\n1 cup of chopped pecans ( i used a half cup)\n1 tbsp cinnamon\nfor the crumble\n2.5 cups of KA unbleached all purpose flour\n1/2 cup sugar\n1/2 cup brown sugar packed\n1 tsp cinnamon\n1/2 tsp salt\n1 cup of unsalted butter, melted\n\ncake: heat that oven up to 350 degrees and prepare a 9\u00d713 pan with non stick spray. in a large bowl sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. in a mixing bowl ( i used my stand mixer for this) beat the sugars and butter together until light and fluffy. scrape down the bowl and plop the eggs in one at a time making sure that each one is incorporated before adding the next.\nadd the oil and vanilla to the mixer bowl and mix until combined. add the creme fraiche or sour cream. in a seperate small bowl mix together the milk and coffee.\nwith the mixer going at a low speed, add the flour and milk in three seperate additions alternating with each other and making sure each in incorporated before adding the next. flour > milk > flour > milk etc.\nscrape down the sides and lightly fold in with a spatula the whipped cream.\nFilling: mix all the ingredients together in a food processor until a crumble paste forms. basically until everything is very finely ground.\ncrumble: put the flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl and mix. pour the melted butter and stir until the butter is incorporated \u00a0and the mix forms clumps about pea size or smaller. a fork worked best for me at this step.\nfinishing touches: pour 3/4 of the cake batter into the pan. sprinkle the filling in an even layer over the cake. pour remaining batter on top of the filling. using a butter knife, lightly create swirls to incorporate some of the filling into the cake batter. do this very lightly because you still want the filling in the center. top with the crumble and bake for about an hour and fifteen minutes. check about 30 minutes in to make sure the top isn\u2019t burning. if it is lightly cover with aluminum foil until baking is finished. when the cake is done remove and let cool before slicing.\nmelt in your mouth and enjoy!\nrecipe was adapted from the holiday issue of SIFT magazine by King Arthur Flour.\u00a0\n\nThe post killer coffee cake appeared first on Binks & the Bad Housewife.", "link": "http://binksandthebadhousewife.com/killer-coffee-cake/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Fanta et Bob - DECO DEFI  - FIN : UN SUCCESSEUR !

December 30 Days of Lists is Open + My Handmade Album Base!\n\nI\u2019m getting ready for the December 2015 round of 30 Days of Lists! Registration just opened up and I just finished prepping my album base. I love it so much I\u2019m a little sad I have to wait for December to get started!\nIn case you haven\u2019t heard of it before (which means you\u2019re new around here, because this is my tenth round participating in the challenge\u2013welcome!), 30 Days of Lists is a journaling challenge with a daily prompt for 30 Days that gets you writing about yourself! Even though I take the fancy scrapbooky approach to #30Lists, all you really need is a pen and paper (or the digital version of those things) and five minutes a day to dedicate to documenting YOU. \nKam and Amy, the ladies behind 30 Days of Lists, really pack the challenge full, so registration comes with more than the prompts. Check out the registration page to learn about giveaways and all of the bonus goodies included.\n\nFor my album, I used the cover of an old book and stitched in folios of patterned paper to make my own custom mini! I included 32 pages\u2013one page for each list and enough room for a title page and a cover page. The pages measure 6\u00d78, which is a fantastic minibook size, especially if you are using 3\u00d74 journaling cards. \n\nI\u2019m working on a workshop teaching multiple methods for making minibooks and journals from old books called Rebook, so if you\u2019re interested in this method, make sure you\u2019re signed up for my newsletter to be the first to know when registration opens up (and to get an exclusive discount).\n\n\n\n\nThis album was great for stash busting through my older patterned paper\u2013I mixed the old and the new! I went with a few winter-themed pages, but mostly just stuck within a color story of true blue, navy, robin\u2019s egg, browns, pink, and a tiny bit of green and yellow. I used the cover as a jumping off point and found papers that coordinated with the patterned papers I had with the colors of blue I needed in them.\n\nI haven\u2019t decided 100% what I\u2019m doing for my inner pages this round. I know I\u2019m going to be using the rukristin 30 Days of Lists stamp to make my own journaling cards for the lists themselves and the 3\u00d74 cards from the Ashley G December Daily Add-On Kit to number the lists. \nBut I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m setting up my pages yet. I really loved adding a photo for each list in my September 2015 list album, but I\u2019m participating in December Daily this year and don\u2019t know if I want to do a photo in this album AND photos in that album. There are pros and cons: this album is not focused on being holiday-y and is about me rather than my whole family, so the photos for each will be very different. But it will also be nice to do this project in a simple way during a busy season. We\u2019ll see!\nIf I end up adding photos, they\u2019ll probably be 3\u00d74 and I\u2019ll split up each page in the album into four quadrants\u2013one for the numbered card, one for the list, one for the photo, and one for the patterned paper background. If I don\u2019t, I might just center the numbered card and list side by side and border them with washi tape or ribbon, leaving the patterned background to show on the bottom and top of the page. It all depends on if I decide to go with photos!\n\nAre you participating in 30 Days of Lists this round? What are your plans for the challenge?\nI\u2019m an ambassador for 30 Days of Lists, so I spread my love of the challenge in an official manner.

My mother and my music.\nMama was taken from me too soon, and now music is all I have left. It\u2019s the thing that\u2019s pushed me right out of backwoods Georgia into Los Angeles, where the line between fantasy and reality shimmers and blurs. I\u2019m finally making my way, making my mark. I can\u2019t afford to fall for one of music\u2019s brightest stars. Not now. Music is all I have left, and I\u2019m holding on tight with both hands.

The only constant, it\u2019s taken me to heights most people only dream about; a gift dropped in my lap at birth. I thought it was enough. I thought it was everything until I met Kai. Now she\u2019s all I think about, like a song I can\u2019t get out of my head. If I have to chase her, if I have to give up everything \u2013 I will. And once she\u2019s mine, I won\u2019t let go.\nGoodreads\n\u00a0\nExcerpt\n\u00a0\nI shouldn\u2019t have come. All the things I felt and fought, the things I suspected he felt too, he just spewed all over me. And as much as I want to be, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ll never forget seeing my Mama in bed for days after Daddy left. And even though she got up, I suspect a part of her never left that bed, but just stayed there, waiting. We had to leave the house where she grew up and where I spent my first years, because Daddy left us with nowhere to go. Mama learned to stand on her two feet, and I\u2019ve done the same. I just didn\u2019t count on Rhyson sweeping me off of them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously on different pages about this.\u201d I pull my hands free and turn to leave, but he steps in front of me, blocking my grand exit. \u201cLet\u2019s talk later.\u201d\n\u201cEnough talking.\u201d\nThe heat of his body grabs me before his hands do. He traps my chin between two fingers, taking my mouth in a paradox of rough and tender. I want to move. To slide away from his body pressing me into the pool table. But I can\u2019t.

In four surges they have already murdered the majority of the earth's population.Teenager Cassie is one of the sole survivors, preparing for the fifth surge of the alien invasion.I'm not sure what happened here and how it happened but this is definitely my favorite read of the year. And it's November, so that says a lot. This was my first audio book in a long time, and I'm very, very happy I chose this one.Prose to die forYancey manages to write the most relatable teen girl protagonist I have encountered in YA so far. Cassie's voice is just essentially teen, her thoughts, her feelings. I can't imagine how a fifty year old man managed to pull that off. I'm honestly truly, truly impressed.I especially enjoyed the first chapter, which is essentially a monologue, but with a truckload of depth.\u00a0Cassie's feelings about the invasion are described so powerfully and so movingly that I couldn't even do anything else while I listened to the audio book. I was absolutely sucked into this strange world.Usually I groan when authors don't jump right into the story, but Yancey is\u00a0inexplicably\u00a0talented at info-dumping the heck out of the reader and still leave you yearning for more. The premise, the alien invasion, is just executed masterfully. Yancey doesn't give much information about it in the first place, but sprinkles the info-dumps all over the first chapters, so you find yourself yelling at the audio book narrator to hurry up / frantically turning the pages (whichever format you prefer).There's only one clich\u00e9 in this book. And it's my pet peeve...The only things I didn't like as much about the book relate to the (of course we have one) love triangle. I really don't like them. I'm sorry.Yancey made it a little more bearable by setting the whole thing up from the start. Cassie's infatuation with this boy Ben from her school is mentioned very early in and I understand and it does make sense, but love triangles are just a red flag for me. I'm sorry, other authors ruined this for me.It just doesn't seem realistic for Cassie's super crush to have survived all of this, when a huge portion of humanity died. I'm surprised that Yancey went for this, because he's so realistic in his writing everywhere else. The invasion isn't sugarcoated, it's just WAR. Blunt, ruthless war without compromises. There are more plot twists that I can count, but then Yancey goes for the most persistent and arguably annoying clich\u00e9 in dystopian YA:\u00a0the love triangle between the MC, the crush/ old friend, and the rebel. Man. But seriously, this is the only thing I don't like about this book....On audio narration:I listened to the German audio book from Der H\u00f6rverlag Audible, which is narrated by Merete Brettschneider, Achim Buch, and Philipp Baltus as the protagonist Cassie and her love interests respectively. \u00a0Because I loved the book so much, it wasn't a smart choice to listen to the audio book - the narration speed is much slower than my own reading speed.\u00a0Mainly because I'm an insanely fast reader when I love a book. Brettschneider uses pauses frequently for emphasis, which does work in terms of narration, but I just wanted to binge-listen the whole thing. I wish there had been an option to speed the whole book up a little.\u00a0However, the character voices are so, so, so spot on. You hardly find a narrator that can pull off male AND female voices flawlessly. Brettschneider sounds believable as a 16 year-old teen just as much as a 40-something Dad. It's a little terrifying how good she is, actually. I didn't even notice it's the same person talking. This sounds strange, but she really is that good at sounding like men. I'm in awe. She could have single-handedly narrated the whole audio book alone.Rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u00a0Overall: Do I Recommend?I'm an alien enthusiast and I have read more alien books than I can count. BUT: This is by far my favorite.It's written so relatably, so believably, and the world building is amazing. \"The 5th Wave\" reads like mixture of \"The Reapers are the Angels\" and \"The Host\". Just more ruthless and realistic. If an alien invasion is ever going to happen in my life time, this is how it's going down. \"The 5th Wave\" should be compulsory reading for all YA alien stories fan. Nevermind me while I run to the next book store to pick up a physical copy of this as well.Additional Info Original Title:\u00a0The 5th WaveAuthor:\u00a0Rick YanceyPublished:\u00a0April 14th 2014\u00a0Pages: 496Medium: AudioPublisher:\u00a0Der H\u00f6rverlag AudibleGenre: YA / Sci-Fi / AliensASIN:\u00a0B00JAD6RPUSynopsis:\"After the 1st wave, only darkness remains.

My feet followed the sound, stepping absently closer to it, and I finally pressed my ear against the wall leading to my hallway, my heart racing as the vibrations touched my skin.\u00a0Resting my cheek against the surface, I swallowed the tight lump in my throat as the thumping against the wall grew faster and faster.\u00a0There was someoneover there. In the empty apartment.\u00a0Holding up my phone, I dialed the office downstairs but got no answer. I knew there was a night manager named Simon Something-Or-Other, but I didn\u2019t think many people were on duty at night. He must be away from his desk.\u00a0I continued listening, wondering if I could ignore it and just wait until morning to ask the manager about it, but the further down the hall I travelled, the louder it got until I was standing next to the rear entrance.\u00a0Opening up the door, I peeked my head into the hallway, holding the heavy steel exit open just enough to inspect.\u00a0Glancing to my right, I saw a door just like mine. And then I heard a woman\u2019s high-pitched cry ring out around me, and I started breathing harder.\u00a0And then there was another cry. And another, and another, and...Was she having sex? My mouth fell open as I tried not to laugh.\u00a0Oh, my God.\u00a0But I thought theplace was supposed to be empty.I steppedout, knife in hand\u2014just in case\u2014and walked quietly down to the other door, glancing up and seeing small security cameras along the wall, probably installed when the apartments were built.\u00a0Pressing my ear to the door, I listened, still hearing the thump, thump, thump of something hitting the wall, and the girl\u2019s breathy cries over and over again.\u00a0I folded my lips between my teeth, covering my smile with my free hand.\u00a0But then the woman cried out. \u201c No! Ah, oh, God! Please!\u201d\u00a0And my face fell, hearing the fear in her voice. The short, shrill screams were now different. Panicked and scared, and her cries sounded struggled. My mouth suddenly went dry as I stood there listening.\u00a0\u201c Ah!\u201d she cried out again. \u201c No, please stop!\u201d\u00a0I backed away from the door, not finding it funny anymore.\u00a0But then somethinghit the door from the other side, making a loud thud, and I scurried backward. \u201c Oh, shit,\u201d I gritted out under my breath.\u00a0I shot my head upto the cameras, now wondering if they fed to Security downstairs or to whoever was inside the apartment. Did they know I was out here?\u00a0I spun around and dashed for my door, grabbing the handle and trying to twist it.\u00a0But it was locked. \u201c Dammit!\u201d I mouthed. Fucking thing must lock automatically.\u00a0Another thud hit the door, mere feet away from me\u2014so close\u2014and I darted my eyes over to it, my breathing turning fast and painful.\u00a0I pulled on the door handle again, twisting and yanking, but it didn\u2019t budge.\u00a0Another thud hit the door, and I jerked upright, dropping the knife.\u00a0\u201c Shit.\u201d\u00a0I dived down to pick it up, but just then I heard the other door swing open, so I bolted down the stairwell, hiding behind the wall and forgetting about the knife.\u00a0Fuck!Screw this. Whoever was coming out of the vacant apartment was definitely someone I didn\u2019t want to meet.

In fact, SkinCeuticals is partnering with practices and medi-spas throughout the country to create exclusive Advanced Clinical Spa and Aesthetic Centers. What does this mean for you? Leading dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and medi-spas are exclusively offering SkinCeuticals products, providing easy to follow regimens designed to\u00a0combat everything from discoloration to anti-aging\u00a0\u2013 oh\u00a0and bundling complementary skincare into your treatment ... tell you just how exciting this is.\n* Given the years of research and development dedicated to each and every SkinCeuticals product (not to mention that very scientific/medical foundation and background) I was totally expecting the brand to be as intimidating ... skin concern or category and more.\n* Speaking of all that makes them unique, another thing I really love about SkinCeuticals is its packaging. Owned by L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the brand knows us gals want products that are going to work and look ... the most fabulous mad-scientist?
