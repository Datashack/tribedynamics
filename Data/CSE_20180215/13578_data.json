If youve ever thought about starting your own online store or wondered how the process works for those Prime products, I have a special interview with the owner of the resort-wear clothing line, Back from Bali, sold exclusively on Amazon.\nI first met the founder, Leslie, a couple years ago at the American Womens Club of Zurich and she told me she owned a clothing brand. I was instantly curious and ordered a Back from Bali baby blue and white floral dress (below). Im always nervous about ordering clothes on Amazon, but Back from Bali didnt disappoint! The tunics, dresses and cover-ups are feminine, ideal for any summer getaway and best of all  you wont feel guilty adding it to your cart because there isnt a single piece that will break the bank. Plus, the story behind how Leslie started her brand is truly inspiring if youve ever wanted to start your own business. Now, meet Leslie\n\nQ. What inspired you to start Back from Bali?\nLeslie  I traveled for seven months to Indonesia many years ago and loved it. When I returned, I needed to get a job and while looking in the paper (which is what you did back then) I had a light-bulb moment where I remembered the colorful gorgeous batik clothing that I had seen in Bali.\nI took out a calculator and did some numbers and realized I could make some money if I went back and bought. I jumped back on the plane and started buying off the streets at different stores in Bali. The truth is, what inspired me, was not getting a job in an office ever again! And I loved traveling and beautiful fabrics.\n\nQ. How does your quality differ from other resort style brands sold online? Especially because your collection is made in Bali unlike many other clothing brands, how has it been producing a product there?\nLeslie  What I love about producing in Bali is there are no factories that I work with. I work with many Balinese women who have their own small businesses with perhaps 2-10 sewers. My production there is truly grass roots. I work only with cottage industries there. I have vendors sitting on floors hand crocheting, others making batik sarongs in traditional ways, and others working with their families hand sewing crystal embellishments onto tunics.\nAnd I love my vendors! I have been working with many of them for many years. I go from one hug to the next. I know many people say their clothes are made with love, but I really mean it. Back From Bali supports small women businesses in Bali, who really care.\n\nQ. How do you design the collections and determine what styles to make based on the season or knowing what will sell?\nLeslie  I have absolutely no design experience or training. My grandmother and great grandmother had a successful clothing shop and sometimes I think I just have it in my blood. I go with my gut and what I like and what feels right. I am very conscious of costs as I want to be able to offer fabulous clothing at great prices. I work with several designers and it truly is a collaboration.\nThe hard part often is not knowing if it will sell or not, and so I just have to go for it! For this last season, there was a sample we made, and when I saw it I got chills and I loved it, and I knew this was going to be a hit  and it is. I find you just have to have the feeling and try things. Ultimately, its the customer who decides what works as I try to follow their lead.\n\nQ. You sell your line exclusively on Amazon. Would you recommend this to others looking to start a new business?\nLeslie  Amazon has changed my life. I never even physically see the goods from my production, as it all gets bar-coded in Bali, and then gets shipped using UPS to different Amazon warehouses. (then sales are fulfilled  shipped by Amazon). I truly have an online ecommerce business. I am from New York, manufacture in Bali, live in Zurich and can live anywhere I want as long as I have internet connection. For me this is the ultimate freedom. I love it!\nI totally recommend doing this, but it takes work, strategy, and perseverance. There is a lot to know on how to be successful on Amazon. You dont just add products to the site and sit back and collect- I work very hard for my success.\nQ. What are some of the challenges or advantages to running your business in the US while living in Switzerland?\nLeslie  This is why selling online is so fabulous. Having an online business allows you to be anywhere and there are no downsides to that. There are challenges with living in another country on a personal level, but thats another topic!\n\nQ. What do you love most about Bali? Any travel tips?\nLeslie  I love the Balinese people and their culture. They have an amazing religion that only exists in Bali. And every part of their day is influenced by their beliefs. Giving offerings to the good Gods and the bad Gods happens several times a day. You see police officers with a flower behind their ear givin", "link": "http://www.savvyspice.com/2015/08/back-from-bali-founder-spills-her-secrets-to-selling-online.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": 0}, {"text": "Chocolate Cherry Lush!\n\n>>>http://www.momontimeout.com/2015/02/chocolate-cherry-lush-recipe/ http://www.momontimeout.com/2015/02/chocolate-cherry-lush-recipe/", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/154156720190/posts/10155940260695191", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], "model_decision": 0}, {"text": "Taking a break from #vlogmas with a #lush bath bomb and Made in Chelsea #heaven \u2728 Tagged: @lushcosmetics", "link": "https://www.instagram.com/p/-6p4VAx1tQ/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [1, 1], "model_decision": 1}, {"text": "girls, it's been way too long @naturally.tess @rawganic_ \ud83d\udc6f\nLoving @ecotan and @spunkychicthelabel at the moment \ud83c\udfdd\ud83c\udfd6\ud83c\udfdd Tagged: @ecotan, @2020ave, @lushcosmetics, @purecocobella, @oceangem_swim, @flora_remedia, @spunkychicthelabel", "link": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BAHXVCyFBW3/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [1], "model_decision": 1}, {"text": "The lovely people from @lushltd are extremely generous and they invited me to try the Synaesthesia Spa Treatment and it was one of the most ... first time at a spa!) thank you so much for this gift guys, you really didn't have to \u2764\ufe0f Tagged: @lushcosmetics, @lushltd, @lushoxfordstreet", "link": "https://www.instagram.com/p/_kPKF8pRL2/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [1, 1, 1], "model_decision": 1}, {"text": "\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Yay!

This thoroughly solidifying her status as a class-A nerd. She currently works as a high school English teacher, a job that she loves even when it exhausts her. In her free time she writes, reads great books, and takes care of her two beautiful and crazy children. Her young adult best selling series, The Breeders, is available now on Amazon.

But as Lucy looks forward to her trip, a sinister plot is unfolding that will demolish the world as she knows it.\nAn unknown bioterrorist group unleashes a virus that virtually wipes out the earth\u2019s population\u2014leaving Lucy, and a small faction of survivors, trapped inside her high school to wait out the apocalypse. War, looting, and death wreak havoc outside the school; inside, the students must contend with a tyrannical and paranoid principal and their own struggles of being orphaned, frightened, and unsure of what the future will bring.\nWhat begins as a basic fight for survival turns into a search for answers that will challenge everything Lucy has ever known about her life and her family.\nVirulent is the first book in the Virulent trilogy, an enthralling post-apocalyptic adventure that takes you from the end of the world to the formation of a new society.\nPurchase Link: Amazon\n\u00a0\nAuthor Shelbi Wescott\nShelbi Wescott is a high school Language Arts and Creative Writing teacher, a mother of two, a television junky, and a board game connoisseur.

In her free time she writes, reads great books, and takes care of her two beautiful and crazy children. Her young adult best selling series, The Breeders, is available now on Amazon.

When Riley was born, her mother escaped the Breeders, the group of doctors using cruel experiments to bolster the dwindling human race. Her parents do everything possible to keep her from their clutches-- moving from one desolate farm after another to escape the Breeders' long reach. The Breeders control everything- the local war lords, the remaining factories, the fuel. They have unchecked power in this lawless society. And they're hunting Riley.  When the local Sheriff abducts the adult members of her family and hands her mother over to the Breeders, Riley and her eight-year-old brother, Ethan, hiding in a shelter, are left to starve. Then Clay arrives, the handsome gunslinger who seems determined to help to make up for past sins. The problem is Clay thinks Riley is a bender-- a genderless mutation, neither male nor female. As Riley's affection for Clay grows she wonders can she trust Clay with her secret and risk her freedom?  The three embark on a journey across the scarred remains of New Mexico-- escaping the Riders who use human sacrifice to appease their Good Mother, various men scrambling for luck, and a deranged lone survivor of a plague.

When Riley was born, her mother escaped the Breeders, the group of doctors using cruel experiments to bolster the dwindling human race. Her parents do everything possible to keep her from their clutches-- moving from one desolate farm after another to escape the Breeders' long reach. The Breeders control everything- the local war lords, the remaining factories, the fuel. They have unchecked power in this lawless society. And they're hunting Riley.  When the local Sheriff abducts the adult members of her family and hands her mother over to the Breeders, Riley and her eight-year-old brother, Ethan, hiding in a shelter, are left to starve. Then Clay arrives, the handsome gunslinger who seems determined to help to make up for past sins. The problem is Clay thinks Riley is a bender-- a genderless mutation, neither male nor female. As Riley's affection for Clay grows she wonders can she trust Clay with her secret and risk her freedom?  The three embark on a journey across the scarred remains of New Mexico-- escaping the Riders who use human sacrifice to appease their Good Mother, various men scrambling for luck, and a deranged lone survivor of a plague. When Riley is forced into the Breeder's hospital, she learns the horrible fate of her mother\u2014a fate she'll share unless she can find a way out.\u00a0   Author Katie FrenchKatie French imagined herself an author when her poem caught the eye of her second grade teacher.

They strap ya to a bed and all ya hear is the thud of your heart and the cries of your friends as they wheel ya down to hell. Then the doctors come. You squeeze your eyes shut and pray you can forget. But ya never do.\u201d     Sixteen-year-old Riley Meemick is one of the world's last free girls. When Riley was born, her mother escaped the Breeders, the group of doctors using cruel experiments to bolster the dwindling human race. Her parents do everything possible to keep her from their clutches-- moving from one desolate farm after another to escape the Breeders' long reach. The Breeders control everything- the local war lords, the remaining factories, the fuel. They have unchecked power in this lawless society. And they're hunting Riley.     When the local Sheriff abducts the adult members of her family and hands her mother over to the Breeders, Riley and her eight-year-old brother, Ethan, hiding in a shelter, are left to starve. Then Clay arrives, the handsome gunslinger who seems determined to help to make up for past sins. The problem is Clay thinks Riley is a bender-- a genderless mutation, neither male nor female. As Riley's affection for Clay grows she wonders can she trust Clay with her secret and risk her freedom?     The three embark on a journey across the scarred remains of New Mexico-- escaping the Riders who use human sacrifice to appease their Good Mother, various men scrambling for luck, and a deranged lone survivor of a plague. When Riley is forced into the Breeder's hospital, she learns the horrible fate of her mother\u2014a fate she'll share unless she can find a way out.      Author Katie French Katie French imagined herself an author when her poem caught the eye of her second grade teacher. It was about birds and frankly, it wasn't very good, but it sparked a love of literature. In middle school she spent her free time locked in her room, writing her first young adult novel. This thoroughly solidifying her status as a class-A nerd. She currently works as a high school English teacher, a job that she loves even when it exhausts her. In her free time she writes, reads great books, and takes care of her two beautiful and crazy children. Her young adult best selling series, The Breeders, is available now on Amazon. She also has a kids series starting with Portia Parrott and the Great Kitten Rescue for ages 5-9.      Praise for The Breeders    Kindle Book Review, 2014 Kindle Book Awards Semifinalist     Over 45,000 downloads so far. More than 300 four and five star reviews.

I was completely enthralled after the first few pages.\u201d -- Amazon Reviewer  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Virulent by Shelbi Wescott    Lucy King is only an hour away from embarking on the most incredible vacation of her life: White sandy beaches in a tropical paradise, snorkeling and sunbathing in peaceful tranquility. But as Lucy looks forward to her trip, a sinister plot is unfolding that will demolish the world as she knows it.     An unknown bioterrorist group unleashes a virus that virtually wipes out the earth\u2019s population\u2014leaving Lucy, and a small faction of survivors, trapped inside her high school to wait out the apocalypse. War, looting, and death wreak havoc outside the school; inside, the students must contend with a tyrannical and paranoid principal and their own struggles of being orphaned, frightened, and unsure of what the future will bring.     What begins as a basic fight for survival turns into a search for answers that will challenge everything Lucy has ever known about her life and her family.     Virulent is the first book in the Virulent trilogy, an enthralling post-apocalyptic adventure that takes you from the end of the world to the formation of a new society.

I think it\u2019s because my fans had such a fantastic reaction to the first appearance of the hero, Chris Jacobs, in BURIED as a secondary character. I\u2019ve never received so much email about a character. I put a lot of pressure on myself to create a story worth this honorable character.\n\nChris was abducted as a child and held in an underground bunker with his schoolmates by a sadistic serial killer. After two years, Chris and another boy escaped, but his friend died before reaching safety. Chris assumed his dead friend\u2019s identity, knowing his own family could be killed if they discovered he was alive.\n\nIn BURIED, Chris is reunited with his real family, but the novel belongs to his brother, Michael Brody. Readers clamored for Chris to have his HEA and I knew he needed his own novel, not a novella. I worked hard to come up with a love interest that was worthy of Chris.\n\nGianna Trask is a forensic pathologist with a teen daughter and a background that slightly echoes Chris\u2019s past. They have both been through hell and are drawn together by their shared pain. Everything Gianna believes about her past is turned on its side when a dead body shows up after her remote cabin catches fire. She and her daughter are trapped outside the cabin in a snowstorm until Chris appears.\n\nDuring every word I wrote, I felt like I had my fans looking over my shoulder, wanting the best for Chris. It had a tendency to make me second guess every decision, drawing out the creative process. But I now feel like I did him justice. I hope my fans love Gianna as much as they adore Chris and agree that they are perfect for each other.\n\u00a0\nExcerpt \u2013 KNOWN\n\nChris\u2019s brain shot into fifth gear.\n\nIt had been at a full stop as he told Gianna that he remembered everything about his captivity with the Ghostman. He hadn\u2019t shared his memories with anyone since Brian\u2019s mother, Elena. His secrets had died with her. Early on, Michael and Jamie had asked a few leading questions, but he\u2019d shut them down. He didn\u2019t want their minds polluted with images from his past. They had imaginations; they could use them.\n\nBut with Gianna it was different. She\u2019d moved toward him when he alluded to the horrors that had been done to him. She hadn\u2019t run. She hadn\u2019t rejected him. For one terrifying, heart-stopping moment he\u2019d thought she\u2019d look away; instead she\u2019d reached out.\n\nHe\u2019d grabbed her offering and clamped on like a man dying of thirst.\n\nAs he kissed her, he acknowledged that he\u2019d been closed off for years. Gianna had gently touched his surface, sending small waves across his senses. The waves had rippled over the black memories that\u2019d risen to the surface and calmed them, buried them. He hadn\u2019t fought his usual internal struggle to make the images vanish; they\u2019d simply dissolved.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t a fool. They weren\u2019t magically gone. But they\u2019d never fallen away into the background with such ease.\n\nSince he\u2019d first seen her, Gianna had soothed his environment. Usually he escaped to his cabin to find that calm; yesterday he\u2019d discovered it\u2019d followed him back home on two legs. Two petite legs attached to one of the most gorgeous women he\u2019d ever seen.\n\nAnd she accepted him. She\u2019d looked right into his nightmare and not shied away.\n\nHer heart beat against his and he ran his hand up into her hair, cradling her skull. She felt so small under his fingertips. Her hand was still clutched in his, gripping like she was scared to let go, and he held their clasped hands against her back, feeling the soft give of her skin and the harder bumps of her spine. With her arm behind her she was open and vulnerable to him, but she didn\u2019t seem to care. He tightened his hold on her, causing her to exhale, and she turned her lips from his, her breath brushing over his cheek. He moved his lips up her face to her cheekbones and her eyelids, to her forehead.

But dig a little deeper and the cinema\u2019s passions were alive and well \u2014 and associated with some mostly sharp films. With a few exceptions, movie sex was the dominion of indie comedies and prestige drama this year. It might get thrown into TV shows with abandon, but filmmakers have begun using it more thoughtfully recently. (Unless, of course, we're talking about the phenomenon that is\u00a0Fifty Shades of Grey, but we'll get to that.) Now let\u2019s dig into some of the year\u2019s biggest sexy movies.\n1. Trainwreck\n\nWe have the mismatched Amy Schumer and John Cena to thank for the funniest sex scene of the year. Watching\u00a0Schumer prod Cena into some ill-advised dirty talk sets the tone for a movie's that's oversexed while somehow not being totally gratuitous with all that raunchiness. Those dirty jokes are making a point!\u00a0The most telling scene comes when one character makes a joke to her boyfriend about Amy\u2019s sexual past, and quickly apologizes, shows shame, and walks out of the room. Because yes, women deserve to be able to enjoy sex without being shamed for it.\n\n2. Love\n\nIf the difference between art and porn is knowing one from the other when you see it, it's going to be hard for some to figure out why, exactly, Gaspar Noe's 3D ode to \"sentimental sexuality\"\u00a0isn't being screened exclusively in seedy adult theaters. The French filmmaker filmed real, largely improvised, sex scenes with his cast to tell a story of longing, love, and lust. The result, which played widely on the arthouse festival circuit, received mixed reviews, with some critics complaining that the main character was too much of a jerk to really be that interesting. Still, it was the only movie this year to deliver a literal 3D moneyshot.\n\n3. Fifty Shades of Grey\n\nThe\u00a0Fifty Shades books took kink mainstream, and the movie adaption brought it all to glorious life. Fortunately the film didn't take itself too seriously, allowing fans to enjoy a few giggles as they indulged in an erotic journey that was safe enough to see with your friends, but not your mom. Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson worked admirably to bring on the steaminess of the books to the screen. Haters predictably hated, but a surprising number of critics were won over by the film's mix of lust and fun.\n\n4. It Follows\n\nA monster movie that doubles as a metaphor for coming-of-age fears and anxieties,\u00a0It Follows takes a\u00a0ridiculously simple premise \u2014 a sexually transmitted ghost \u2014 and turns it into something both meaningful and haunting. The old joke about life being a sexually transmitted disease with a 100 percent mortality rate is made literal as a group of teens tries to figure out how to stop a slow moving ghost that slowly follows and follows and follows its prey until it finally kills them or they have sex with someone else. Not only does the film successfully articulate some all-too-real moments of young adult sexuality, it also solidifies Maika Monroe as one of the most interesting up-and-coming leading ladies in the industry.\n\n5. Magic Mike XXL\n\nIs it wrong to make a sequel just for the eye candy? It's rare for a movie to cater so blatantly to the female gaze, and to have so much fun while doing it. The theatrical equivalent of hitting up a\u00a0Chippendales show,\u00a0Magic Mike XXL does have a plot and drama and conflict, but those things felt secondary to serving up loving shots of oiled up abs and rhythmic male thrusting. It wasn't as good a film as its predecessor, and it suffered some diminishing returns at the box office, but it still made it home at the end of the night with enough cash stuffed into its G-string to possibly warrant a third movie sometime in the not-too-distant future.\n\n6. Tangerine\n\nFollowing two trans prostitutes on the rough and gritty streets of LA,\u00a0Tangerine starts out feeling like a gawkfest, but it taps into something deeper as it explores the friendship between its two main characters. There actually isn't much sex in the movie, but one scene finds us watching\u00a0a man give a trans prostitute oral sex as they pass through a car wash. So that's a first.\n\n7. The Overnight\n\nWith a cast that gamely tackles some over-the-top sexual shenanigans,\u00a0The Overnight\u00a0follows a couple of young parents\u00a0new to LA (Adam Scott and Taylor Schilling) getting to know a couple of local parents (Jason Schwartzman and\u00a0Judith Godr\u00e8ch) in unexpectedly intimate ways. The moment of crowning glory comes with some bonkers full frontal male nudity as Schwartzman and Scott dance together while celebrating their anatomical differences \u2014 Schwartzman wearing a giant prosthetic enhancement and Scott wearing a much much tinier one.\n\n8. The Diary of a Teenage Girl\n\nExploring the very inappropriate relationship between a teenage girl (newcomer Bel Powley) and her mom's boyfriend (Alexander Skarsgard),\u00a0Diary\u00a0follows the titular girl's\u00a0perspective to try and offer an honest, nuanced take ", "link": "http://www.zimbio.com/Beyond+the+Box+Office/articles/vixiMjRRt5b/Sex+in+Movies+2015", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0], "model_decision": 0}, {"text": "It doesn't have to be most lush or greenest tree (or fanciest menorah) to spread holiday joy.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/33989251494/posts/10153871660611495", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0], "model_decision": 0}, {"text": "and simple, so if youre someone who tends to wear heavier makeup you may need a more intense makeup remover.\nLush Charity Pot Body Lotion\nThis has quickly become my new favourite lotion.

And their wedding? Well, its a perfect extension of that energetic love that they share. From moments like this that will make you grinto giant balloons to adorable kisses with pup in tow, theres so much to loveabout this day captured by Braedon Photography. See it all here!\n\n\n  Please upgrade your browser\n\nShare this gorgeous gallery on \nColorsSeasonsSummerSettingsWineryStylesRustic\nFrom Liberty Woodman of Lady Liberty EventsCandace and Mike, These two. The love they have for each is other is that fun, hilarious, exciting and best friend forever kind of love. They werent frou frou fancy, traditional by any means, and frowned at the thought of anything that was cookie cutter. Simply put, they wanted a day that reflected both of their personalities that would be laid back with the perfect touch of elegance and would result in a kick-ass celebration that their friends and family would never forget.\nWe came to an overall event vibe that we called rustic bohemian romance that ultimately would end up as a rave! With our style in place it was time to start nailing the details.\nReady for the ceremony to commence, guests were seated facing the weeping pepper tree where the existing twig canopy was accented with flowing fabric, romantic greenery, and a petite chandelier in the center. While the wedding party was just about done lining up and we were ready to cue the music, I noticed that the groom was sitting in the audience chumming it up with his friends! With a quick tap on the shoulder and a good laugh, Mike made his way up to prepare himself for what he will always remember as the most special part of their big day.\nSince the ceremony lawn was vast, we used antique cottage doors flanked with bushes of wild lavender and garden roses to create a reveal. The front of the doors were accented with their initials, M & C, made with fresh antique hydrangea blooms. This provided a romantic entrance for the wedding party and bride, which also allowed us to shave more than 100ft from the aisle!\nThe ceremony was officiated by one the grooms childhood friends and was by far one of the most touching, personal, and funny ceremonies that I have had the privilege to witness. The bride and groom tied together the strings of two huge peach balloons (representing unity) and released them to signify the unknown adventures that they would embark on together.\nDuring the cocktail hour, guests sipped on specialty cocktails such as spiked lavender lemonade, nibbled on tasty miniatures of Mike & Candaces favorite guilty pleasures, and helped themselves to bottled beer casually chilling in vintage wooden tubs. The guest book area consisted of small note papers for quests to write letters to the bride and groom that they would read on their 6 month, 1 year, and/or 5 year anniversary. This table also displayed Glassy sunglasses that the groom had custom made which donned their wedding monogram. A large, old school, white boom box, was displayed for guests to tag. A hand painted wooden sign that read Mutual weirdness forever, sat under one of the venues gorgeous oak trees, where a trio of large hoops were hung flaunting the guests escort cards.\nCandace loves dream catchers so we wanted to incorporate these in a way that would still create a timeless look without being something that would go out of style or feel dated when they looked back on their day. We hand made a plethora of multi sized dream catchers using vintage lace for the centers with hues of grey, purple, gold, and ivory incorporated into the ribbons, lace and feathers. Utilizing some super cool yarn that we found, which had hints of metallic gold and dark purple threads, these babies were going to have to be placed somewhere special to make a statement. We decided that an installation that hung only over the head table would create a unique and stunning way to highlight the bride and grooms table. With bistro lights strewn over the dinner area, accented with hanging crystal votives, the dream catchers added the ultimate boho touch to the romantic rustic dinner setting.\nThe dinner tables were a combination of raw and reclaimed wood square and kings tables all topped with a smoky purple runner. The bride and groom werent fond of having all round tables, so we integrated a just a few of them to offset the unique layout and to bring in a touch more of the purple color which was one of the grooms favorite hues. A grey linen napkin tied with a raw silk eggplant ribbon showcasing each guests name, and accented with fresh rosemary sprigs, were placed at each setting. Folded over brown paper bags replaced your standard breadbaskets, and purple tinted glassware added the finishing touch to the setting, keeping it simple yet charming.

Now it is time for even more movies from the Marvel/Disney/Lucas Film line! As a HUGE fan of these films, I am so unbelievably excited to see the line up! These movies will all rock your socks off! GO DISNEY GO!!!!\nThis past weekend at the D23 EXPO in Anaheim, CA, Disney, Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm presented their live action film slates which revealed exclusive news and details about the upcoming live action films, aided by live and video appearances from talent and filmmakers. Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn hosted the highly anticipated biennial event.\nIts quite something to be able to have Disney, Marvel and Lucasfilm all on the same stage, and its tremendously gratifying to unveil our upcoming projects to our most dedicated fans first, said Alan Horn, Chairman, The Walt Disney Studios. We always have an incredible time at the D23 EXPO.\nAfter welcoming the crowd to D23 EXPO 2015, Horn introduced Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios, and Sean Bailey, President of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production, to present overviews of the Marvel Studios and Disney live action slates. Later Horn returned to the stage to present the Lucasfilm film slate to the enthusiastic audience.\nAnd now for your movies:\nMarvels DOCTOR STRANGE (#DoctorStrange)\nKevin Feige led off with a glimpse into the world of Marvels DOCTOR STRANGE, featuring a video greeting by Benedict Cumberbatch, who stars as the title character, followed by a pre-production piece that offered fans a taste of the look and feel of the upcoming film, opening in U.S. theaters on October 26, 2016.\nMarvels CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR (#Captain America & #CivilWar)\nMarvels CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR marched into D23 EXPO with an introduction by its producer, Kevin Feige. To the delight of the audience, Chris Evans and Anthony Mackie showed up on stage to help Feige show never-seen-before footage from the movie. Before the footage rolled, Feige revealed that there was a special Easter egg for fans to find: it was aptly a nod to D23 EXPO.\nMarvels CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR picks up where Avengers: Age of Ultron left off, as Steve Rogers leads the new team of Avengers in their continued efforts to safeguard humanity. After another international incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage, political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability and a governing body to determine when to enlist the services of the team. The new status quo fractures the Avengers while they try to protect the world from a new and nefarious villain.\nThe movie stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Emily VanCamp, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Frank Grillo, Tom Holland, with William Hurt and Daniel Brhl. Marvels CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is directed by Anthony & Joe Russo and produced by Kevin Feige. Louis DEsposito, Alan Fine, Victoria Alonso, Patricia Whitcher, Nate Moore and Stan Lee serve as executive producers and the screenplay is by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. Marvels CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR opens in the U.S. on May 6, 2016.\nTHE FINEST HOURS (#TheFinestHours)\nSean Bailey took the stage to introduce the first film in the Disney live-action lineup, THE FINEST HOURS, which is based on the remarkable true story of the most daring rescue mission in the history of the Coast Guard. Chris Pine, who plays Bernie Webber, the captain of the rescue boat, joined Bailey on stage to give fans a peak at the heroic action-thriller.\nPresented in Digital 3D, Real D 3D and IMAX 3D, the film, which is directed by Craig Gillespie and also stars Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Holliday Grainger, John Ortiz and Eric Bana, transports audiences to the heart of the action, creating a fully-immersive cinematic experience on an epic scale.\nTHE FINEST HOURS is produced by Jim Whitaker and Dorothy Aufiero and Doug Merrifield is the executive producer. The film is based on the book by Michael J. Tougias and Casey Sherman and the screenplay is by Scott Silver and Paul Tamasy & Eric Johnson. THE FINEST HOURS storms into U.S. theaters on January 29, 2016.\nTHE JUNGLE BOOK (#TheJungleBook)\nAfter an introduction by Sean Bailey, Jon Favreau, director of Disneys upcoming THE JUNGLE BOOK, welcomed to the stage newcomer Neel Sethi, who was selected from thousands of candidates to play man-cub Mowgli; plus Oscar winners Ben Kingsley, who helps bring panther-turned-mentor Bagheera to life, and Lupita Nyongo, who lends her voice to the protective mother wolf Raksha.

Der Farbverlauf Duo Blush geht von helles Lachsfarben in ein intensives und sattes Pink - also ein wenig anders als ich mir vorgestellt h\u00e4tte aufgrund der Pressebilder, in der von Apricot die Rede war - aber umso besser, in den Pressebildern sah der Blush, der 7,82 Gramm Inhalt birgt, deutlich knalliger aus - das war zum Gl\u00fcck nicht der Fall.Swatch bei KunstlichtDie hellere Seite und der gemischte Swatch (rechts) erinnert mich sehr an den Blush aus der Floral Grunge Limited Edition, der dunkleren Ton hat etwas von der Cinderella Limited Edition.Der Blush ist von der Konsistenz her ein wenig pulverig (also Pinsel abklopfen) und ich habe zuerst vermutet, er w\u00e4re mehlig - allerdings sieht das Ergebnis auf den Wangen sehr gut aus. Der Blush ist wirklich ausgezeichnet pigmentiert, daher w\u00fcrde ich euch empfehlen, ihn nicht \u00fcberzudosieren - au\u00dfer, ihr m\u00f6chtet den David Bowie Ged\u00e4chtnis", "link": "http://aufgerouget.blogspot.com/2017/04/essence-life-is-festival-trend-edition.html", "lang": "de", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0], "model_decision": 0}, {"text": "car au soleil, mes cheveux avait l'air presque blanc !!!

Thus the twins were born.Inhale ... of the two halves, a rather unique floral, fruity and rather unisex perfume that stands apart from everything else that Lush currently offer. Featuring neroli, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, melon, rose, black pepper and vetivert, this is one of the most interesting perfumes ... wearer.Inhale is a light fragrance, despite the rather large list of ingredients that have been used to create it's smell.

Aside from Bath Bombs, the brand's latest newness is the LUSH Jelly Bomb, a skin-loving product that also transforms bathwater into a jelly-like texture. But wait \u2014 it gets better. There ... Harry Potter-themed Jelly Bomb called \"Dark Arts\" and OMG I want to dive right in.The official description on the UK LUSH site espouses the virtues of the Dark Arts Jelly Bomb. It reads as follows: \"When you're feeling like going to ... like something I've searched for my whole life. It's bathcraft.Here's what this transformative product looks like in solid form.Courtesy of LUSHAnother description on the site reads as follows: \"Why not become a professor of Dark Arts? Sink into deep, inky black ... seaweed and almond essential oil. Conjure up this enchanting soak and perplex witches and wizards with your bathtime sorcery.\"Courtesy of LUSHLook at how it fizzes and thickens the water? I want to sink into a tub of this and not care ... cleanup efforts. A further description, provided by Cosmo, contained a specific Harry Potter reference, which I can't find on the LUSH UK site currently.Courtesy of CosmoHere's the screen grab.Courtesy of LUSHThe jelly water is just... magically beautiful. A black bath bomb is life. It's currently available in the UK, per the post's caption.This video from LUSH product inventor Jack Constantine is straight up sorcery.All Things Lush UK on YouTubeHere it is in action. LUSH on YouTubeHow are fans feeling? I've seen some rumblings that it leaves behind a mess in the tub, while LUSH maintains in Twitter replies that the Jelly Bomb is an easy clean up and good for the environment.NEED! \u2014 blaque ... that turns bathwater into a silver slime straight outta potions class?! Yes, please! \u2014 Allison Arthur (@allisonnarthur) July 22, 2017\nLushies and Harry Potter lovers are down.Just saw this Harry Potter related tweet and was immediately intrigued! This a Lush bath bomb you're talking about? #imusthaveit\u2014 Caroline Rebecca (@carriesmith1991) July 21, 2017\nDark Arts combines two things people love.So Lush is coming out with a new jelly bath bomb that is Harry Potter themed.

Der Duft nach Kakaobutter, gemixt mit Orange und Bl\u00fcten war sehr langanhaltend auf der Haut und die Pflege f\u00fchlte ... und Maske waren eine prima gl\u00e4ttende und nachhaltige Pflege. Ich w\u00fcrde alle drei Produkte jederzeit nachkaufen.Das Shine So Bright von Lush habe ich ebenfalls geleert. Die Haarspitzenpflege war okay um meinen Spitzen ein bisschen mehr Glanz zu verleihen. Duft und richtige Pflegewirkung fand ich eher medium.Mit dem Batiste Trockenshampoo in der Sorte Blush habe ich tats\u00e4chlich das erste seiner Art leer gemacht und bin begeistert.

Ich mag die Marke Lush und besonders ihre tollen Schaumb\u00e4der ja total.

Gute 2 1/2 Wochen nach meinem ersten Besuch ging es wieder hin. Es war Zeit f\u00fcr den traditionellen Lush Weihnachtssale. Dieses Mal fand der Sale nur in den Gesch\u00e4ften statt. Das sorgte bei vielen f\u00fcr gro\u00dfe Trauer, da ihr ... L\u00e4den haben. Somit ging es zusammen mit einer guten Freundin, am 27.12. p\u00fcnktlich um kurz nach 10 Uhr auf gro\u00dfe Lush Shoppingtour. Wer kann bei diesem s\u00fc\u00dfen Design schon Nein sagen? Ich nicht.Seasons Greetings Box mit 3 Badebomen und 3 Schaumb\u00e4dern ... in den Stores am Alexanderplatz oder der Friedrichstra\u00dfe, nun werde ich aber lieber ein paar Minuten mehr fahren und dort Lush Produkte shoppen.
