I found all of these products at Walmart, in the \u2018Dermatologist Recommended\u2019 section of the skincare aisle.\n\nOur skin naturally contains ceramides, and over time, they get depleted, leading to dry and irritated skin.

You need healthy products to get healthy skin, right?! I\u2019ve developed my own CeraVe skincare routine that I follow every day to improve my skin\u2019s surface and tone.\nCheck out my five step tutorial:\nStep 1\n\nIn the morning, I start off by washing my face with CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser.
