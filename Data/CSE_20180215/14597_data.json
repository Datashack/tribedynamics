NOTEWORTHY: The Grand Budapest Hotel (FSL) expands for about $9M and another strong per screen; Bad Words (FOC) expands to weak result.\nUPDATED SUNDAY, 7:15 AM: Noah is going to end the weekend around $44M to $45M, depending on percentage drops on Sunday. The question, of course, is how well it will do in its second weekend for Paramount and whether not it has staying power. The dark epic, which marks star Russell Crowe\u2019s biggest opening in his career, bowed overseas already, first in Mexico and Korea and then expanded this weekend to Russia, Australia and 17 other territories for more than $33M, but to get specific numbers and where it stands in each country, read Nancy Tartaglione\u2019s International Box Office story here. Will it be profitable? Paramount claims a $125M budget, but others have it higher. With marketing and distribution costs added on (both domestically and territory by territory internationally), its questionable whether this will float into profitability. We\u2019ll have to wait and sea \u2026 I mean, see. It\u2019s worldwide cume so far is $95M+. On Saturday, most pictures had a nice bump up, with Noah on the lower end with 16% and the kids movies, as always on the higher end (Muppets Most Wanted for instance got a 103% bump Friday to Saturday). Noah draws an older audience and it\u2019s a free-for-all for families on the weekend. However, Noah saw a strong social imprint on the big three this weekend \u2014 Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Co-star Emma Watson\u2019s March 21 Q&A garnered heavy traffic on Twitter with nearly 800 tweets per minute at its peak. \u201cEmma Watson was an incredible force to this campaign and she was very focused on doing things that engaged her social media followers and did a takeover on MTV\u201d which pushed audiences to the film, too, noted Paramount\u2019s president of domestic marketing and distribution Megan Colligan. MTV reaches 70M through its own social imprint. Asked about the C CinemaScore and how the exits polls might impact the film\u2019s second weekend, she said: \u201cThere\u2019s two different kinds of Cs where people are indifferent about the movie and then there is this type of C,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always knew the movie was going to be a bit polarizing and I think we were very aggressive in our marketing. You can see across the board there is a lot of love for the movie. What always made this tricky for everyone is that there hasn\u2019t been a movie like this in 50 years. It\u2019s an epic and also a deeply spiritual film so it runs the gamut of audiences you can tap into. The CinemaScore is a hair misleading in how the people are going to be talking about the movie and how it will play. So we feel really good about how it\u2019s going to play.\u201d It\u2019s worth nothing that Paramount treaded very carefully in bringing this picture to market, engaging faith leaders every step of the way.\nMeanwhile, the same demographic that came out for Divergent (LGF) will have Captain America in theaters next weekend. Great news for the 20 year-olds, but bad news for Divergent which will have to contend with their audiences evaporate with a new Marvel/Disney flick in the marketplace. Divergent has made $95.9M to date and will easily cross into the $100M club later in the week and actually stood its ground in its second weekend to take an estimated $26.5M to $27.1M, down 50% on the same number of screens. Insurgent, The second film based on the Veronica Roth YA series of books, goes before the cameras in May, and will be released next year in the same time frame: on March 20. This weekend\u2019s $100M player was 300: Rise of an Empire which charged past the $100M mark for WBros./Legendary after four weeks in release. And then there\u2019s The Lego Movie which is hovering around the $250M for the studio. Well done, Lord of Business.\nFreestyle\u2019s God\u2019s Not Dead, the other story of the 3-day weekend, saw only a 1% drop in its second weekend and will take in $9M, just a hair under what it did last weekend ($9.2M). Even with adding theaters, that is quite a feat. It\u2019s per screen is a strong $7,715, and its cume after two weeks is $22M. With Easter coming, it could get another pop and estimates are that this film could top out at $40M to $45M.\u00a0God\u2019s Not Dead may have also cracked the Top Five. Right now, it\u2019s in a dead heat with Fox Searchlight\u2019s indie favorite The Grand Budapest Hotel for that honor. When the final numbers come in tomorrow, we shall see. Budapest Hotel, with an addition of 673 playdates, is logging in a per screen of over $9K to bring its cume to $24.4M. After four weeks in limited release, it\u2019s still playing great.

Cheese's With the kids being on Spring Break, it is like a mixed blessing. I adore spending the extra time with my son, and my daughter loves having him around, but since this momma doesn't drive, it is sometimes challenging to find new things to do with the extra time.Nothing is worse than wasting what should be special family time doing the same old things you always do. During the day we play outside on the trampoline and bounce house and such, and we do crafts inside, but when daddy is home, we like to go out and do something fun.There is not a whole lot to do around here though. We mostly go for ice cream or something, which can get old fast. Thankfully a super fun spot recently opened in Port Orange, about 15 minutes from here. Chuck E. Cheese's is like the ultimate kid zone.We took our son there for his birthday(about an hour away before this one opened), and he LOVES it. Little diva loves it too, and so do hubby and I. Our course, since this is a restaurant, there is tons of great food.There of course are beverages too. And right now, the beverages are extra awesome, since there is a cool promotion, the Rip It, Sip It, Win It game.Every cup is a winner! Each of us won 5 extra tickets. This is a great promotion. You should pop in to your local Chuck E. Cheese's and check it out. But hurry the promotion ends March 31st. Of course the food and drink are just a part of the incredible experience. While it may be a small thing, I love that all the kids get free wrist bands. The kids loved that.Right after we got there, Chuck E. Cheese himself made an appearance. The kids were so excited to see him, especially Jr. Chuck lead a game of Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes, and he threw tickets for all the kids to catch.\u00a0And then there are the games, which is what really makes Chuck E Cheese's so unique. There is so much to do at any age. My son did almost everything. And of course, little sis was in tow the whole time. She was fascinated with everything.Both kids especially loved Fruit Ninja, it was played at least a dozen times between them.The fun house photo booth was another favorite. My daughter especially wanted to stay there the whole time.She was kind of too short to be in the right position though, both kiddos were in fact. They still had a blast in there though.They couldn't stay in the fun house booth all day though, there was so much more to do.One little girl discovered the slide, she didn't want to leave. Daddy had to stay with her there while Jr. did other things.This was a photo ride, which is awesome. I love the pic it took.There was a sketchbook booth too, like the Fun house one. We barely got a change to try it though, it was super popular. If the kiddos were taller it would have came out better.The games wee all so much fun. I had a blast playing Ski Ball. I have not played that in forever. Hubby had a great time sharpening his sports skills and playing Deal Or No Deal.And of course after earning so many tickets, it's time to redeem them, but first you have to deposit them all into the Ticket Muncher, the kids LOVE this part.They earned 668 tickets(and actually more that I forgot they had in their pockets. We'll use them next time, lol) plus the 5 ticket bonuses from our Rip It, Sip It, Win It games. They each got a rainbow spring(the kind that \"slink\") and a huge multicolored Disney lollipop.This was the perfect way to spend the day, the kids are already talking about going back. I can see we will be going A LOT now that it is closer to where we live. No complaints from me and hubby though, we love it almost as much as the kids do.If you've never been to Chuck E. Cheese's or don't go often, I suggest you check it out soon. If you go in before March 31st you can take advantage of the Rip It, Sip It, Win It promotion.*Although I received guest passes to facilitate a review, all opinions are 100% my own.*", "link": "http://www.andreasworldreviews.com/2014/03/rip-it-sip-it-win-it-at-chuck-e-cheeses.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "#Sponsored: @Headshoulders #MoistureCare leaves hair flawless and moisturized.  http://t.co/QSvM4LeRpz #Clevergirls http://t.co/pAv8w8Angk", "link": "https://www.twitter.com/_fashiongenius/statuses/566227121559719938", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "RSVP for the @HeadShoulders Family Beauty Secrets Twitter Party! 8/27 12pmPT #PartOfOurFamily http://t.co/82vaglsOiE", "link": "https://www.twitter.com/Latsyrc728/statuses/504961484175069185", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "ets (9/30/14)\nGillette $1/1 shave prep ets (9/30/14)\nGillette $3/1 body razor ets (9/30/14)\nGillette $3/1 men\u2019s razor ets (9/30/14)\nHead & Shoulders $2/1 treatment excludes all shampoo, 2-in-1 and conditioner products ets (9/30/14)\nHead & Shoulders $2/2 full size products excludes 200mL/6.8oz/1.7oz and treatments ets (9/30/14)\nIams $1/1 dry dog or cat food ets (9/30/14)\nIams", "link": "http://www.southerncalisaver.com/2014/08/coupon-preview-831/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "#ad brush your hair before you shower.

She sat in the hallway, but obviously still heard it all, because as we walked into the packed (family practice) waiting room she says super loud: \u201cMom, why did the doctor need to put a SPATULA in your vagina?\u201d I still prefer the last appointment of the day. \n\n2.\u00a0 via Between the Monkey Bars\nOne of the minions just walked in on me changing, pointed to my chest, and said, \u201cMama got little bug bites.\u201d\nI wish I were making this shit up.\nNot even \u201cmedium sized\u201d bug bites, kid?\n\n3.\u00a0 via The 21st Century SAHM\nWhen your 1-year old takes naked pictures of you through the shower doors\u2026 And then your 6-year old finds them in your phone later (at 4-year old\u2019s gymnastics) and yells across the room: \u201cMom!

I\u2019m the only one who realized he meant cologne, like his dad wears.\n\n5.\u00a0 via Appetite for Honesty\nWhile my toddler and I were out doing a little shopping, he saw a life sized cutout of the Kardashian sisters. He proceeded to point at the cutout and yell, \u201cLOOK MOM, IT\u2019S AUNTIE!\u201d No matter how quietly I told him that they weren\u2019t his aunties, he continued to shout, \u201cYES IT IS!

(Cringe).\n\n6.\u00a0 via Good Day, Regular People\nAt the zoo, after I went to the bathroom, I tucked my summer skirt into my underwear somehow and walked out. When I passed my children they all shrieked with mortification. \u201cMOM OMG MOM!\u201d and yanked it out of my underpants for me. I will never be able to convince them I was once cool now.\n\n7.\u00a0 via Papa Does Preach\nAfter recently moving to a state I had never lived in before, I started officiating youth sports. Not knowing the area I got lost on my very first assignment. Once I finally arrived at the school, I asked a person walking by how I could get to the field \u2013 the individual never answered me. Feeling slyted, I expressed my displeasure with the individual and went about my way, only to find out later this was a school for the deaf. Yeah\u2026.I yelled at a deaf guy.\n\n8.\u00a0 via dorkymum\nMy son crawled under the curtain at the doctor\u2019s and climbed up beside me while I was having a Pap smear last year \u2018ooh, what\u2019s that light for, Mummy?

Why are your pants on the floor mummy?\n\n9.\u00a0 via Jsack\u2019s Mom\u2019s Blog\nOne day my son pointed out that I needed to stop eating food because I stink! This was said in a crowded Dr\u2019s office after I had a burrito for lunch, much to my embarrassment. \n\n10. via Mama Needs A Cupcake\nI was getting in the shower when I noticed my daughter\u2019s play kitty awkwardly floating in the bathtub. It was to funny not to snap a quick picture. As I rounded the corner downstairs to grab my phone I discovered two of my husband\u2019s coworkers standing in my kitchen. They were as shocked to see me as I was them!\n\n11. via Juicebox Confession\nI was very pregnant and trying on clothes in a fitting room with my pre-school aged daughter. I took off my yoga pants (the only pants that fit) and my daughter immediately yelled at full volume: MOMMA! YOUR BUTT IS EATING YOUR UNDIES! THAT CAN\u2019T BE OK FOR THE BABY!\nI was wearing a thong.\n\n12. via Wiggle Room Blog\nAt my my nephew\u2019s 1st birthday party today, my 18-month-old had just learned all the words to \u201cHead Shoulders Knees and Toes,\u201d and I called a bunch of relatives around to hear her sing it. Sure enough, she sang \u201cHead, shoulders, knees, and cock.\u201d Everyone\u2019s smiles froze. Perhaps we all heard incorrectly. I tried again: \u201cHead, shoulders, knees\u2026\u201d I looked at my daughter. \u201cAND COCK!\u201d she yelled. So we all applauded, because of course.\n\n13. via Jen Simon, Writer\nI was plucking my eyebrows, halfway paying attention to my toddler open and close my dresser drawers. Before I noticed, he had moved to my nightstand. I didn\u2019t think he could reach his pudgy little hands all the way back there, but he did and managed to pull out my vibrator. That wasn\u2019t the worst part. The worst was that he put it to his ear and said, \u201chello.\u201d \n\n14. via Zoe vs. the Universe\n4yo: What\u2019s in his tummy?\nMe (looking at chubby man w/in earshot): Nothing\n4yo: Is there a baby in there?\nParental Mortification: Next Level\n\n15. via Surviving A Sleep Thief\nMy toddler somehow called the police while I was in the shower.

If you don't have children you may remember singing it when you were younger yourself. One thing that I love doing is being outdoors. Whether it's Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall, I have to be outdoors. I hate being cooped up inside the house so if I can be outdoors enjoying the sunshine and the fresh (or not so quite) fresh air, I'm all up for it. Now while I love running around barefoot when I'm indoors, it's a whole different ballgame when I'm actually outside. I like to have on shoes that are not only comfortable but fashionable as well. After all I like to think of myself as a fashionable pre-schooler. I'm no longer a toddler, can you believe that? Yes I officially entered the world of pre-schoolers when I turned 3. Finding fashionable and comfortable shoes doesn't have to be time consuming and difficult to find either. Not when there's Friendly Rooster there to help you. Not only do they have some of the better brands in the market when it comes to children shoes, but they are also made to help with the proper development of your little one's feet.There is such a selection of shoes to choose from at Friendly Rooster. Here's just a few and you may recognize a few of the names since I have reviewed a few of them right here on Growing Up Madison. A few others I have been wearing since birth since mommy and I just happen to love, love, LOVE them. Shoes like Livie and Luca\u00a0which has been an absolute favorite of ours and Pediped which I've also worn since birth. \u00a0When Friendly Rooster asked that I take a look at another brand that I have never heard of before now I was excited. I know that Friendly Rooster has only the best so I was more than willing to give this new brand\u00a0Tip Toey Joey\u00a0a try.I happened to receive the Tip Toey Joey Hunch and when mommy opened the box, the words out of my mouth were \"I like those shoes\". Those that know me, knows that I'm a shoe connoisseur and those words have to mean something. Now here is something that I have to tell you about Friendly Rooster and Tip Toey Joey before I go on and on. \u00a0Currently they are working together to help infants in need. For every pair of Tip Toey Joey shoes purchased, a new pair of will be donated to a beginning walker in need right here in the United States. I just love companies that gives back!Now usually when I get a shoe I'm always wary that it might not fit true to size. I've had experiences where a shoes tells me one size and when I receive it, it's not quite what I expect because it's a 1/2 size or even a full size smaller. There was no problem with the Hunch. As a matter of fact, I have fairly wide feet and this shoes is perfect for those with wide feet. The velcros make them super easy for me to put on and off and the fact that they are made of leather means that will conform to my feet.Now I had to put these shoes to the test. I wanted to be sure that they were as comfortable as they looked so I decided to wear them for a few hours. I wanted to jump and play around in them. After all the true test of a shoe comes from actually wearing them. You don't wanted pinched toes and I'm also a little too young to see corns and blisters. I hate wearing socks with shoes so I decided to wear these without them for the really true test. I have to tell you that it passed.I jumped around, I ran and I even kicked a ball (although it needed air) and at the end of wearing it my feet were as before I put the shoes on. I couldn't be happier with the Tip Toey Joey brand and I think I now have another favorite. Thank you Friendly Rooster! You and Tip Toey Joey gets my TWO TINY THUMBS UP!Now you have to check out all the other amazingly adorable baby, toddler and little kids shoes on the Friendly Rooster website.Here are the ways to connect with Friendly Rooster:WebsiteFacebookTwitterInstagramPinterestToday Friendly Rooster wants one of you to win the shoe of your choice by offering you a $75 Gift Card.

But what if we produce too much milk?\u00a0It may sound like a luxury to have, but, believe me, oversupply\u00a0can be extremely frustrating for everyone involved. I experienced it with both of my babies and it took me some time to learn how to handle it. In this post, I\u2019ll share some ways to handle engorgement and oversupply.\nBefore we start \u2013 a special gift for you\nI cover a ton of material in this post. Want a really simple one-pager?\nDownload my cheat sheet on Oversupply: Tips on Engorgement and Making Too Much Milk.\nIssues with\u00a0engorged breasts and oversupply\nHaving too much breast milk can result in baby consuming too much foremilk and not enough hindmilk. Foremilk is the thin, watery, and lactose-rich component of breast milk that is great for hydration and quick energy. Hindmilk is the creamy and fat-rich part of breast milk that provides nourishment, satiety, and contentment. It\u2019s vital that baby gets a balance of both parts of milk to ensure optimal digestion and assimilation (not to mention a happy baby). Breastfed babies who receive too much foremilk suffer with excess gas (thinking farting, lots of belching, hiccups, etc.), hunger and even colic. That\u2019s because the foremilk can digest too quickly, without the fat of hindmilk to slow it down, resulting in malabsorption and intestinal distress, not to mention frequent feeding (and sore breasts!) since the milk isn\u2019t as satiating. Sometimes with oversupply, you are also going to deal with\u00a0engorgement. Engorged breasts are painful and usually occur shortly after birth and subside within 5 days postpartum. If they continue, this is probably more breast \u201cfullness\u201d than engorgement, which is an inflammatory response that occurs with the onset of nursing. Either way, we\u2019ll talk about some measures to help ease the discomfort of engorged breasts and oversupply\u00a0in this post. And hand in hand with oversupply is often too\u00a0fast\u00a0of a letdown, which is often referred to as overactive letdown. Signs of fast letdown include\u00a0baby choking, coughing, or pulling back at breast. Baby may also squeal, squeak, or gulping excessively while nursing because the breast milk is coming out too fast. For strategies for how to manage overactive letdown, see this post. Overactive letdown doesn\u2019t always occur with too much milk (or oversupply) and vice versa. They each have their own set of issues and solutions. This post will focus on those who\u00a0struggle with\u00a0oversupply and engorgement. Please note: these suggestions would only be appropriate if your baby is gaining weight at a normal to\u00a0above average rate. \nOversupply and engorgement suggestions\n\u00a0\n1. Give it time\n\u00a0 Know that your oversupply is partly by design. In fact, most mamas have some degree of oversupply in the first 4-6 weeks postpartum to be sure baby has enough milk and there aren\u2019t twins to feed. Coupled with this, most babies have an immature digestive system, are still learning how to extract milk effectively and usually\u00a0have some sort of acid reflux. As a result, we see babies struggling regardless of how much milk you have (or how fast your letdown is) because they are learning how to assimilate food outside of the womb. Take warm baths to soothe your engorged breasts\u00a0and try to ride it out those first several weeks if you can. Many moms who struggle with engorgement and oversupply\u00a0will self-regulate without any further action. \u00a0 \n2. Block feedings\nSince milk production is generally based on a supply and demand loop, meaning the more you stimulate the breast, the more milk it will produce, you may want to offer just one breast per feeding. This tactic is called Block Feeding. I remember thinking this would never work and I would get too engorged in the other breast, but I was wrong. While there were a few days of discomfort, my breasts quickly adjusted and this is how I ended up nursing Griffin throughout our entire breastfeeding relationship. For mom\u2019s with severe oversupply issues,\u00a0you can even offer that same breast for the next feeding and then offer the second breast five to ten minutes later. That way you can be sure baby will get all of the good hind milk, and it will probably be a\u00a0more\u00a0pleasant nursing experience, since the milk letdown won\u2019t be as rapid as the breast empties.\u00a0This will also help to regulate your\u00a0overall milk production, since you\u2019re not stimulating both breasts at each feeding. Be sure to work with a Lactation Consultant to decide if block feeding\u00a0is right for you, and if you are in fact, dealing with oversupply. \n3. Laid back breastfeeding\nAlso called biological nurturing, this often overlooked breastfeeding position is great for babies and mamas who are struggling with oversupply (and the digestive distress it can cause). When baby nurses from above the breast (lying tummy to tummy on a reclining mama) he is able to deal with overactive let down much better, since gravity ", "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MamaNatural/~3/WjTAziBq7ow/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 1, 0, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "(teachers only)\nAtkins Starter Kit\nBreathe Right Nasal Strips\nBioFreeze Pain Relief Gel\nTena Samples\nAnimal Parade KidGreenz Children\u2019s Chewables\nHead & Shoulders\nReal Time Pain Relief\nPet:\nWag Lifetime Joint Care for Dogs\nBeneful Healthy Smile Dog Food\nPurina One Dog Food", "link": "http://www.frugalcouponliving.com/2014/02/15/round-free-samples-offers-subscriptions-215/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "#sponsored: I'm talking light manipulation hairstyles with @Headshoulders #moisturecare on the blog.

Ok so I took a little sabbatical from blogging. As you may or may not know I'm currently in nursing school and this semester was tough. Actually it was extremely tough not only from the school perspective but in life as well so I put the blog aside to focus on my family and school. The last time I did an update on Gabi she was 11 months going on 1 year. Now she is 16 months going on 17 and has changed so much! This age is absolutely amazing. Gabi is talking like crazy, I keep saying that its like her brain has exploded and she is absorbing and learning everything! Everyday she learns a new word, its incredible!We have always spoken to Gabi in a mixture of Spanish and English, but lately we have begun speaking only to her in Spanish since her vocabulary has really taken off. We are also spending about 1.5 months in Colombia this summer so its perfect timing for her to really learn Spanish.Her current list of new words include: (I really wish I could remember them all)\"Mimmee\" (Mickey, which is her favorite stuffed animal that she takes everywhere)\"Patos\" for zapatos (shoes in spanish)\"Uno, dos, cuatro\" - she hasn't said tres yet, which I find hilarious and the first number she learned was cuatro, she loved that one first I guess.\"Tank You\" - she learned this one a while ago and says it everytime somebody gives her something or she gives somebody something, such a polite little girl.\"No, no, no\" - she now says this for everything, I even found her yelling it at her daddy's shoes the other day, which I'm not really sure why but it was incredibly cute. When she says \"no, no, no\" she also wags her finger the same way I do when I tell her no, which is hilarious.\"Mama, mami\" - for me of course\"Papa\" for daddy and the occasional times she yells for her dad by saying \"MAMA\", which is too cute, we usually correct her and say no that's papa not mama\"Luna\" - its actually more like Una and we are pretty sure this was her first word.\"Baby\" - when referring to herself\"Gabi\" - also when referring to herself\"Gato\" - which quickly follows with \"Meoww\" when we ask her what sound the Gato makes.\"Wow,wow\" for dog which also quickly follows with \"woof, woof\" when asked the sound a dog makes.\"MOO\" for cowShe knows to point to her head, eyes, nose, mouth, and toes when we sing \"Head, shoulders, knees and toes\" and the only word that I have heard her say is \"Nariz\" for nose\"GO\", when we say Ready, set, go and then she runs off\"Happy\", we like singing her the song Happy by Pharell and we often change the word Happy to Gabi and she sings along with us\"Wow and whoa\" whenever I say it, she copies meWe taught her a little spanish song that goes Pom, Pom, Pom el manito en el bolson, la patica en la bolsita, ay yi yi mi cabezita, ay yi yi mi cabecita - Gabi says \"Pom, Pom, Pom\" and also says \"ay yi yi\" while touching her head and shaking it back and forth, its adorable.\"Side\" for outside, which she loves and if she could play outside all day she would\"Ciao\" and \"Buh bye\" - she also waves her hand anytime she says these\"Yummy, yummy\" - for food, particularly if she wants a bite \"Na, ni\" which is her word for wanting to breastfeed, she often just starts saying this out of the blue and will escalate into shouting it and pulling at my shirt, I find it cute but that's just me I guess\"Agua\" for her water\"Uva\" for grapes\"Na, na, na\" for banana\"Ball\"\"Pee, Pee\" whenever we change her diaper\"Ba berries\" for strawberries \"Mhmm\" when she likes something shes eating\"Hello\" whenever putting the phone to her ear\"All done\"\"Yay\"\"bubbles\"\"Uh Oh\"\"Libro\" for bookNew Behavior:Gabi loves mimicking everything we do and say, which is probably my favorite thing that she is doing right now.She also loves to help us around the house, particularly she loves helping mommy throw things away. We have learned to be really careful and we now hide the trash can and the recycling bin. Let's just say that you know you have a toddler when, you discover your cell phone at the bottom of the trash can covered in coffee grinds. Thank goodness it wasn't dead!Gabi has always loved music and loved to dance, she is the cutest thing whenever she dances, she shakes her bottom and her shoulders. It is serious cuteness overload.Gabi started mimicking Joe the other day when he was doing insanity.

First of all, the Green Apple scent is amazing. It's light and crisp ... scalp feel cleaner in between washes than it ever has before. I've learned that one of the great things about Head & Shoulders is that it's primary goal is to care for the scalp, which it obviously does, but doesn't sacrifice the beauty ... hair color vibrant, turns course hair into soft waves and leaves the scalp feeling extra clean.See the results of my Head & Shoulders use and learn how to win a trip to meet Sofia Vergara under the cut!After One Wash:After Three Washes:Not too bad huh?

It seems that we have been getting a few of them lately and it does give me some extra time to myself. Running a blog isn't entirely easy. I've had a few people ask me how much time I spend on my blog on a daily basis, and I tell them this all the time, if I don't find the time to take a break I'll be on here all day. Between writing up and editing my posts and networking, it's a full time job. Well Alyssa Craig is here today to help out with something that I have always been fascinated with, the human body. As many of you know I was an Army Medic so it was my job to patch adults up. It's entirely different however when it comes to teaching kids about the human body. How do you introduce and teach kids about the human body? Take it away Alyssa!The human body is a fascinating specimen with many different parts, functions, and abilities, both seen and unseen. As children grow, teaching them about the human body can be both instructional and fun.When teaching anyone about the human body (whether it is young children or medical students), there are two main ways to break it down: regionally or systemically. For example, you can either learn about the head and go over the brain, the four senses located on the head, and discuss hair, or you can learn about the central nervous system. The route you choose should match the age and learning abilities of the child you are teaching, as the body is quite complex.Here are some suggestions for fun ways to teach children of all ages about the body.Younger ChildrenFor very young children, focus on helping them identify basic body parts such as :headfingermouthnoseeyeearhairhandfootlegarmteethSimple games are a great way to help children learn to identify parts of the body. Such games include:Head, Shoulders, Knees and ToesIf You\u2019re Happy and You Know ItSimon Says: This game can be adapted based on the child\u2019s understanding. For example, the prompts may range from \u201ctouch your arm\u201d to more specific directions such as \u201ctouch your right arm\u201d to more complex statements like \u201ctouch your left arm to your stomach\u201d, incorporating multiple body parts. Take turns, allowing your child to both do what Simon says and also tell you what to do.You can also help children become more familiar with the body through activities.Cut out a shape of a person, along with pictures from magazines of articles of clothing. Help the child \u201cdress\u201d the person and teach them where different clothes should go on the body. You can also use paper doll sets.Write a list of body parts and put them in a hat. Have the child pick body parts from the hat and then let them draw a picture that matches what they picked out. Make it silly and put things such as \u201cthree arms\u201d, \u201csix eyes\u201d, etc.Older ChildrenOlder children already have these basics in their knowledge bank, so give them activities that will help them learn more about the systems of the body, as well as more complex anatomy.Buy a large piece of butcher paper and trace the outline of the child\u2019s body to cut out. Have the child also cut out shapes of the body\u2019s major organs. Then teach them where all the major organs go, while also teaching them their functions. You can also play this game simply by cutting out pieces of sticker paper and have the child place the sticker on their own body above the corresponding organ.Use different colors of play dough to form the different parts of the brain while discussing which functions each part regulates.When it comes to the heart, there are many activities you can do.Teach the child how to take their pulse and then show them how it changes as they do more strenuous activity (like running and playing). Explain how this helps the body pump more blood and circulate more oxygen and nutrients the body needs to complete these activities.Use water and a tennis ball with a hole drilled in the top to demonstrate how the heart fills with blood and then pumps it out to the rest of the body.Use an empty paper towel roll as a rough stethoscope and have the child listen to their heartbeat (or yours!). Teach them how the sound they hear is actually the blood rushing in and out of the heart.Fun Facts for KidsAs you teach your child about their body and all of the amazing things it can do, don\u2019t forget to include some fun facts along the way.Here are a few to get you started:There are 100,00 miles of blood vessels in an adult human body.The strongest muscle in the human body is the masseter (jaw muscle).The ears and nose never stop growing.Just as we all have unique fingerprints, we also have unique tongue prints.The human eye can distinguish about 10 million different colors.Your heartbeat changes and mimics the music you hear.Your bones are composed of 30% water.The gastrointestinal tract (GI Tract) is a 30 foot tube running from your mouth to your anus.One step requires the use of up to 200 muscles.With so much inf", "link": "http://www.growingupmadison.com/2015/03/teaching-kids-about-the-human-body.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "you think you may use.Coupons.comSmartSourceRedPlumAlso, here\u2019s a list of the coupons that will be disappearing soon from Coupons.com:$2.00 off TWO Head & Shoulders Products$3.00 off Gerber Good Start Gentle Formula$2.00 off BOOST Nutritional Drink or Drink Mix$1.00 off one Florida\u2019s Natural Citrus Smoothies$4.00", "link": "http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/65035618/0/frugalfinders~End-of-the-Month-Coupon-Print-Reminder-May/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Aussie, 29.2 pz $4.99Makes it as low as  $3.32 each WYB 3 after $5 Gift Card  Herbal Essences, 23.7 oz $4.99Head & Shoulders 14.2 oz $4.99$2/2 Head & Shoulders Product, exp. 3/31/14 (P&G 03/02/14)Makes it as low as  $2.66 each WYB 3 after coupon and $5 Gift Card  Pantene,", "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/HOVy/~3/wFvB2IL31yE/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "and UPRFresh Guard - $5.99Get $5.00 UPR\n$1/1 Efferdent Fresh Guard Product, 03/02 SS (exp 4/2)\nFree after coupon and UPRHead & Shoulders  - $4.50Get $1.00 UPR wyb 2 $2/2 Head & Shoulders Product, exp. 3/31/14 (P&G 03/02/14)$2/1 Head & Shoulders Treatment Product, exp. 4/30/14 (P&G 03/30/14)$1/2 Head & Shoulders Products, exp. 4/30/14 (P&G 03/30/14)*\u00a0$15/$50 MIR P&G Beauty Product Purchase, exp. 4/30/14 Mail-in RebateBuy (2) Head & Shoulders $9.00\u00a0use (2) $2.00/1 CouponsPay $5.00Get $1.00 UPR$4.00 or $2.00 each after coupon and UPR\u00a0Irish Spring Body Wash - $3.99Get $1.00", "link": "http://forthemommas.com/drug-store-deals/rite-aid-deals-preview-330-best-deals", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Powered Haircolor, exp. 5/31/14 (RP 04/06/14)$3/1 Garnier Olia Oil Powered Haircolor, exp. 4/26/14 (RP 03/02/14 R)Final Price= $5.99 each wyb (1)Head & Shoulders Haircare 13.5-14.2 oz., $4.99$15/$50 MIR P&G Beauty Product Purchase, exp. 4/30/14 Mail-in Rebate$1/1 Head and Shoulders Product, exp. 6/30/14 (Conagra", "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LittleRockMommy-ExtremeCouponing/~3/Ih_PQRyQV0w/kmart-ad-match-thru-426.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Mail in Rebate; Includes CoverGirl, Pantene, Secret, Ivory, Herbal Hair + Body Wash, Aussie, Clairol, Safeguard, Olay Skin, Olay Body, Head & Shoulders, Old Spice, Vidal Sassoon Color and Venus Products; Rebate Applies To Price Paid After any Coupon or Discount Has Been ...

What does that mean? They smell good in the ... hair parted on the side or down the middle? In any case, Smooth & Silky has turned me into a Head & Shoulders fan, and I'll be parting my hair any way I please.And here's something else you might not know: Actress Sofia Vergara and her family have been Head & Shoulders users for over 20 years! Look at all those luscious locks:With that in mind, Head & Shoulders is hosting a sweepstakes. The prize? A chance to meet Sofia Vergara at an upcoming Head & Shoulders advertising shoot!

[1, 1, 1, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "Same Teacher, Different Classroom I've been asked many times before, in years past and even now, and it's always the same question:\u00a0 Do you ever miss teaching?\u00a0 Do you miss being\u00a0at school?\u00a0 Friends, family, former colleagues, you name it.\u00a0 Anyone who knows me and knows\u00a0the educational path I pursued wants to know if I ever feel understimulated, bored, or displaced\u00a0because I am not \"practicing my craft.\"\u00a0 And do I\u00a0sense that I'm not doing what I was meant to do?\u00a0 This is my answer.I don't miss teaching because it has never left me.\u00a0 The classroom I report to every day is my home, my workplace, and my world with my family and my children.\u00a0 Each day, they are my students and they are also my teachers.\u00a0 I still make lesson plans and to-do lists--and I still don't finish them.\u00a0 I am stocked\u00a0with paper, pencils, books, crayons, grilled cheese sandwiches, and anything else that could ever be classified as an instrument of learning.\u00a0 I teach music and dance as we sing If You're Happy and You Know It and Head Shoulders Knees and Toes for the 11th time in one morning.\u00a0 I coach P.E. as we run outside chasing balls and butterflies, or swing upside down on a bar.\u00a0 And then again in the afternoon while we're picking up\u00a0knocked over trash cans and building obstacle courses out of family room furniture.\u00a0I teach art while we color pictures of\u00a0Mickey Mouse,\u00a0and then patiently\u00a0exhale and agree that yes--blue crayon on a yellow table does, in fact, make green.\u00a0 Fine motor skills are practiced when we construct itsy bitsy spiders out of paper plates, or when we make Patty the\u00a0Pig puppets out of felt.\u00a0I teach math as we count the blocks we stack.\u00a0 And as we eat each Goldfish cracker, we practice our numbers backwards.\u00a0 We\u00a0count\u00a0kisses, add laughter, multiply messes, divide laundry, and\u00a0subtract vanilla wafers from the box.\u00a0 It's a unique order of operations over here.I teach reading and language almost every\u00a0waking\u00a0moment of our day.\u00a0 And it is the\u00a0cornerstone of how we say and show each other that we love one another.\u00a0 While reading books together, we laugh and we also cry (I'm sure you're familiar with this gosh darn tear jerker.)Seriously, every. single. time.I teach science when we\u00a0observe water boiling or\u00a0demonstrate the effects of helium on the human voice.\u00a0 I teach about\u00a0changes in matter,\u00a0like the solid food I served\u00a0him for dinner greeting\u00a0me again at the end of its digestive journey.\u00a0 And then\u00a0once more\u00a0when\u00a0day surrenders\u00a0to night and our sky is freckled with a million stars.\u00a0 One of which is named after our son, thank you Aunt Michele and Uncle Rik!I teach social studies\u00a0wherever we go, as we learn about people who are like us and those who are different.\u00a0 A shopping mall is a perfect place to study culture and societal norms, don't you think?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The best thing about being a teacher then was that I always benefited from learning myself.\u00a0 And it's still the same now.\u00a0 I'm always trying to figure out how to solve some sort of puzzle.\u00a0 And some days I feel like I'm nailing it, while others have me searching in the Lost and Found for my mind.\u00a0 But if there's\u00a0one thing\u00a0I'd like to pass on to my own kids, it is that you will always be learning, so learn to be okay with being a perpetual beginner.\u00a0\u00a0For once you are an expert, it's time to move on and find something new to learn\u00a0again.\u00a0\u00a0Like a Lift-the-Flap book, there's always another surprise ahead of you.\u00a0 Except if Jackson already tore the flap off, in which case--then you saw\u00a0it coming.\u00a0\u00a0 The last thing Jackie says in this\u00a0video is \"more.\"\u00a0 And that could not make\u00a0me\u00a0happier.\u00a0 I love that he craves knowledge and learning as much as I do.\u00a0 And every day that I'm able, I will give more.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I will always be a teacher.\u00a0 I feel like it's just a part of who I am.\u00a0 And who knows, maybe one day I'll be back in the classroom.\u00a0 But for now, I am enjoying this part of my life.\u00a0 And I cannot think of a better way to utilize my\u00a0skills, my energy, and my passion than that\u00a0which comes\u00a0from being a mom.", "link":

Office: \u2018Heaven Is For Real\u2019 Surprises; \u2018Captain America\u2019 May Pass $200M And Flips The Bird As \u2018Rio 2\u2032 Perched at No. 2; \u2018Transcendence\u2019 Soft \nOPENING: Heaven Is For Real (SONY) best opener est. $18.9M to $20.1M\u00a0 (3-day) and $26.8M to $27M+ (5-day); Transcendence (WB) No. 4 with $11.5M to $11.8M; A Haunted House 2 (OPRD) $9M to $9.4M in top five; Bears (DIS) hibernating with $5M at No. 9.\nUPDATED, SATURDAY, 7:17 AM: Positions have not changed this morning \u2014 Captain America: The Winter Soldier is No. 1 three weekends in a row for Disney/Marvel and Rio 2 is in the second spot for Fox, but estimates have been revised slightly. Captain America\u00a0is now expected to gross $24.5M to $25.4M compared to $23M for the animated sequel Rio 2, which is now lower at $23M+ for the 3-day. It looks like Captain America will cross $200M this weekend or come very close to it at least. And next weekend, the franchise has a strong possibility of holding on to No. 1 for the fourth weekend in a row. If it does so, it will be the first picture since Hunger Games to do so in 2012 and before that The Dark Knight in 2008. There is nothing of circumstance opening next weekend to put the whoa\u2019s on it (competition is the female comedy The Other Woman, the late Paul Walker starrer Brick Mansions, and the horror film The Quiet Ones).\nSony/TriStar\u2019s Heaven is For Real is in the $18.9M to the $20.1M range for the three-day with the 5-day gross now estimated to be $27M+, depending on how much the picture drops on Easter Sunday. Traditionally, moviegoing peaks on Good Friday and then falls off a bit on Easter Sunday as people tend to spend time at home with their families; it is unlike the heavy moviegoing seasons of Christmas or Thanksgiving when the marketplace is flooded with moviegoers of all ages as school kids and college students have long breaks and people can\u2019t wait to get a break from family get togethers. However, faith-based pictures, have been enjoying stronger holds on Sunday. The picture, produced by Joe Roth and TD Jakes with filmmaker Randy Wallace at the helm, was well adapted from  the bestselling book of the same name by Wallace and Chris Parker. It was also well executed with an overall A CinemaScore and those 35 and under gave it an A+. The picture is based on the true story of four-year-old Colton Burpo who almost died and then came back only to astonish his parents with people he visited in Heaven (like his great grandfather whom he could not have known yet described in detail). Having had a near death experience myself, there is no rational/medical explanation to elucidate what I witnessed in detail either.\nHeaven is For Real opened strong this past Wednesday to $3.7 and continued Thursday with another $1.37M; so it started the weekend with a solid $7M. Just two weeks ago, looking at tracking, there was virtually no unaided awareness for it, so what happened is the faith-based moviegoers (who Hollywood is unable to track) came out yet again this year to support a God-themed movie. According to Sony, \u201cThe audience demographic is 62% female and 38% male with 49% under 35 years of age, showing strength among faith-based as well as mainstream audiences.\u201d\nSad news for Warner Bros., Johnny Depp and producer Alcon Entertainment\u00a0this morning as Transcendence estimates have descended in its opening weekend to $11.5M to $11.8M; can\u2019t beat bad word-of-mouth on a C+ CinemaScore either so this picture will likely drop hard in its second weekend. Estimates for Marlon Wayan\u2019s A Haunted House 2 from Open Road Films have not really changed. The first Haunted House had a much stronger opening weekend last year with $18.1M and went onto gross $40M domestically. This one is opening to half of that, around $9M to $9.4M (Open Rd. is the only one predicting $10M and says it\u2019s budget was $4M \u2013 that doesn\u2019t include marketing costs). Scary. The last opener of this weekend is Disney\u2019s Bears, which is a live-action nature show that could have easily been distributed through the National Geographic channel (it has that kind of feel to it). Narrated by John C. Reilly, the little film is expected to pull in around $5M for the studio. That is a snapshot this morning and here is the updated chart:\nmore\n1).

She's not a big fan of heat like me, and really dislikes having sun lotion put on, I now have scars to prove it..SundayAbbie woke up in a super grumpy mood, so after having a super long nap I decided to take her to her Grandpa's house for a run around to keep her busy! The sun was out, Abbie had a little kick about with Grandpa and explored the gardens too, before we headed home and snuggled up watching some tv as she wasn't feeling herself at all!Monday was a bit more of a mellow day, Abbie had an upset tummy so we stayed at home and just played in the paddling pool for the afternoon!TuesdayProbably our busiest day, Ben was off work so we always try and spend the day out together, so off we went to the park at 9am, Abbie had full reign of the playground much to her delight! Although she'd much rather spend 45 minutes sat on the swings, unless of course another child turns up and plays in the sand, then she'd rather do that, obviously. Abbie wore her gorgeous new dungarees from F&F, I totally wish they did it in adult sizes, not that I could pull it off, but still.In the afternoon, Abbie's other Grandpa came over (she has 3 you know, lucky girl!), so we enjoyed a lovely afternoon of coffees, hot chocolates and cakes before heading off to the park \u00a0for another run around and play, then headed back home for a big Chinese dinner, to finish! So good!\u00a0This was probably the fastest has ever fallen asleep too, within 10 minutes actually usually it's at least 45 minutes, parenting win!WednesdayAbbie woke up in a blissful mood, so we headed off to soft play with Granny, we had the whole place to ourselves for a good 20 minutes which is practically Disneyland for Abbie! This was the first time she actually had enough confidence to play on everything, she even threw herself around on the bouncy castle, dove head first into the ball pool and danced around in front of the mirror! I didn't take any photos as the lighting is terrible in there but there's some footage in the vlog at the end of the post!A family friend popped round\u00a0in the afternoon, who\u00a0hasn't seen Abbie in a long while, and obviously Abbie decided to be a super grump again so that was quite fun...but hey, toddlers will be toddlers! But it was a lovely little catch up anyway and Abbie did calm down once she had the Peppa\u00a0Pig game on my phone, phew!ThursdayIn the\u00a0morning we played out in the garden most of the morning, paddling pool and bubbles galore! Abbie had a panic attack when I turned on the electric\u00a0pump for the pool, I don't think i've ever seen\u00a0someone jump that high in my life! So I had to leave it to\u00a0blow itself up whilst consoling her, poor monkey! Still, she was happy\u00a0once it was all ready for splashing and getting Mummy soaked!For the afternoon we headed out to take some\u00a0photos of Abbie in her new dress from Mamas & Papas, you can see our review here.\u00a0She looked so girly and pretty and wandered off into the wild flowers by herself\u00a0quite happily, so I got the photos I needed pretty quickly, then we\u00a0might've had to bribe her to sit down, that's where surprise eggs come in very useful!FridayThis was probably the hottest morning we've had in about 3 years! Ben was off work till the afternoon so we decided to pop to a lovely little park not too far from us, give Abbie another run around but also to get some more photos of her in her gorgeous new dress! The lighting was so lovely and once again we had the entire park to ourselves, yay!\u00a0This was probablyt the first time Abbie hasn't spent the whole time on the swings, she wandered off and tried the climbing frame, the tunnel and even the zip wire, it's so amazing watching her little imagination at the moment, she walks around acting out scenarios, singing and dancing and sometimes reciting Peppa Pig episodes, it's pretty adorable, she gets properly into them! One in particular was 'The Playground', where Peppa gets stuck in the tyre swing, so of course Abbie jumped at the chance of getting stuck in one too...damn you Peppa!SaturdayAfter a super early wake up time of 6.20am, (usually 8am), Abbie was surprisingly happy and cheerful for the morning, it makes things so much easier let me tell you! Me on the other hand, i'm not great with routine change or lack of sleep, so to say I was grumpy may be a little understatement..The morning was spent reading books, playing puzzles and watching Abbie give us her own little performance of Head, Shoulders, Knees & Toes! It was beautiful I must say! She then fell asleep for her nap super early and had an hour and a half of sleep before we had some yummy lunch and headed off to Nanny & Grandpas house!\u00a0Again, considering she was up so early, this was the most well behaved she has ever been in any given day!

I can\u2019t do it anymore. Not this way.\nLast night my toddler thought 3 a.m. was the perfect time to watch television, and I couldn\u2019t convince him otherwise for over an hour. At Mommy and Me, he almost ran into a parking lot full of school buses. Then he lay on the floor crying after class because the teacher forgot to sing \u201cHead, Shoulders, Knees and Toes.\u201d\nAfter-school pickup for my 8-year-old destroyed me. It always does. His teachers say he\u2019s a perfect angel, but as soon as he sees me, all the angst of his day comes pouring out. He pranced out of school and pounded his backpack into my stomach while complaining that I forgot to put chocolate milk in his lunch. Then he tossed his big coat into my arms and ran out to the playground to play with his friends.\nBoth of my boys had a blast playing outside, climbing trees, chasing balls and running up slides. They were nice to the other kids: They shared snacks and caught\u00a0their friends if they started to fall. My kids are cute. I love watching them play in the bright fall afternoon. They make me smile.\nBut then it was time to go, and suddenly all the cranky came\u00a0pouring out again. My big kid wanted\u00a0to suddenly leave right now, but my little kid didn\u2019t. My big kid pulled\u00a0my little kid by his jacket hood. I pried\u00a0his hands off his little brother and threatened to take away after-school screen time. Finally I convinced (bribed) both kids to leave, but the walk home was just as annoying. The big kid corrected\u00a0everything the little kid said, and the little kid sped\u00a0so fast ahead of us, I was sure he was going to run into oncoming traffic.\nUsually, I give them a free pass. Usually as much as their antics drive me crazy, I have empathy for them. After all, they\u2019re just kids. They\u2019re good kids, and I\u2019m blessed to have them. I know it\u2019s healthy for them to save all their big kid feelings\u00a0for me, their trusted mama. I allow them to do that\u2014to cry in my arms, to push the boundaries with me.\nBut today I was done. Today I was resenting every last second of motherhood. I felt\u00a0like a servant. It felt\u00a0like a one-way street. I felt\u00a0vulnerable and shattered open. Today I wanted\u00a0me\u00a0to matter too.\nWhen we got\u00a0home, I had\u00a0a new resolve. It\u2019s called \u201cFuck this shit.\u201d\nThe boys thew\u00a0their shoes into the hallway, and I told\u00a0them, calmly, sternly, to please put them on the shoe rack. I wasn\u2019t yelling. I wasn\u2019t losing my shit. I was owning my words, saying\u00a0it like it is.\nBig boy protested. Little boy put his shoes away; he can tell when I mean business. Big boy followed suit, then immediately leaned his pathetic cuteness into me, grinning with his crooked teeth. He told\u00a0me he was starving and asked\u00a0me to make him a bagel and pour him a glass of lemonade. Then he ran\u00a0into the den to start his after-school screen time.\nI stopped him in his tracks: \u201cOkay, get the toaster down. Get yourself a cup from the cupboard.\u201d He looked at me like I had\u00a0nine heads\u00a0and\u00a0started to whimper, \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d I knew\u00a0he was, and most days I give in and make him his snack.\nBut today I said\u00a0simply, honestly, \u201cI\u2019m tired too. I need your help.\u201d\nHe whimpered again, then pulled up the stool to get the cup and crouched down to get the toaster.\nThe same thing happened when I asked him to take out his homework and put it on the table, and then again when I asked him to take out his lunchbox and put it on the counter. He protested a little, then just freaking did\u00a0it.\nLittle boy wanted a bagel too and whined for it. I asked him to please ask nicely. \u201cPweeze?\u201d he said, his big, green eyes lighting up.\nSoon my big boy was telling me about his day, playing with the settings on the toaster, helping his little brother get a cup for juice. Both kids were\u00a0laughing with each other and me. Big boy asked\u00a0me about a story I\u2019ve just published. Little boy stroked my hair.\u00a0The kids were\u00a0helping and being nice. Glimmers of compassion were\u00a0showing through. I felt\u00a0listened to and respected.\nI usually ask for cooperation. I usually insist on it to some extent. We have rules that the kids are expected to follow and consequences for when they don\u2019t. But often it just becomes easier to give up on it all and not follow through\u2014either that or I blow my fuse and yell.\nToday, no. Today my needs are as important than theirs. I am a woman\u2014their mom\u2014who expresses what she wants, who stands up for herself.\nToday I told the truth. I said, \u201cI need your help,\u201d because I did, because I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I wasn\u2019t barking out orders. I wasn\u2019t laying out rules. It was about me, what I needed from them, laid bare on the table.\nAnd by some miracle, they listened. They cared.

While we all try to find comfort in the loss of a beautiful and lively soul, we've been reminded of lovely happy memories. She was a spitfire and a joy to be around, one we will all surely miss. In trying to get her affairs in place, I remembered a paper I wrote seven years ago for a Public Speaking course. We were assigned to write a tribute speech about someone we admired. Well, I went to the first person I generally think of honoring in my life, my grandma. She's a special lady, wise and knowing, with a good sense of humor. She could bring people together during any situation like the time she started a poker game during a layover at the airport. No family event was complete without a roaring round of \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" and every birthday you got a phone call with her singing \"Happy Birthday\" just to you. Anyway, I wrote a tribute speech just for my grandmother. I had to dig through the garage to unearth the old laptop and hope and pray that the paper still existed. Luckily for me, I found exactly what I was looking for. Just for Geneva, Grandma Extraordinaire \u201cA woman is like a tea bag; you never know how strong she is until she gets into hot water.\u201d Eleanor Roosevelt pegged the women of my family. My mother, my aunts and my sister seem to share the same characteristic of unfailing strength, especially when confronted with a difficult situation. I can\u2019t neglect to mention the amount of love, creativity and positive outlook that flows through each of these women as well. I see these as family traits passed down to younger generations, but the source of it all, I believe, comes from the strongest link of our family, my grandmother. My grandmother, Geneva, is the most positive, caring, creative and strong woman I have ever met and I don\u2019t even think she realizes it.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After spending five minutes with my grandmother you would immediately understand why she was a first grade teacher for 39 years. Her beautiful smile, bubbly personality and ever-lasting positive outlook on life is perfect for the classroom. She is known in our family for waking us up with a song every morning. Even every day activities like cleaning up or driving to the grocery store has an equally appropriate tune as well. No job is too great or too important that it can\u2019t have its own theme song; to her way of looking at it, that musical ditty only makes the work more fun for everyone, and she\u2019s right. \u201cHead, Shoulders, Knees and Toes\u201d\u00a0\u00a0is her classic morning wake-up. She\u2019s always looking to learn something new and keep up with today\u2019s new technology. Take the computer for instance: Grandma can successfully check her email and look up weather.com all on her own now. It only took 3 months to teach her how to unlock her cell phone or send a picture without taking 63 shots of herself instead of her target. I\u2019ve even taught her how to send text messages using T9 word\u2014the next task now is teaching her how to make a smiley face and boy, is she excited about that!\u00a0When the chips are down no one can pick you up like Grandma. It\u2019s something about the way she encloses her arms around you for that \u201cwelcome back\u201d hug when you visit her. Maybe it\u2019s the way she pats your hand and say\u2019s \u201cChere, baby!\u201d that makes all seem right in the world. Either way my grandmother comforts like no one else! Perhaps she\u2019s had enough practice raising four children and working with kids for almost a half century. She is fearless when it comes to tears. Distance between us makes it hard to get that Grandma-hug in, but she embraces the challenge and comforts us through a simple \u201cI love you\u201d card or offers a comforting word over the phone. No amount of space can keep Grandma from sending her love!  Need help with any project at all? She\u2019ll be there with bells on ready to help in any way she can. She\u2019s a master with projects, too. I\u2019m a poster project princess because of my Grandmother, AKA the Queen of Arts-&-Crafts. \u00a0My grandfather was a professor at Texas Tech making both my grandparents advocates for education, but they came to understand that a teacher\u2019s salary doesn\u2019t pay for too much. My grandmother wanted her kids to have the best she could provide, so she used whatever she had to work with. She taught her daughters how to sew and embroider all their clothes, baked goods were used for gifts at the holidays and summer long camping trips were taken as a family vacation and a learning experience. My grandmother taught me how to make a backyard into a jungle full of adventure. She showed me the secret to drawing a perfectly proportioned person and how doodles can turn any school supplies into a work of art. She let me take her childhood stories and toys and turn her house into a time machine. I am never bored when in the presence of my grandmother; she is always full of life and full of fun. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I think ", "link": "http://juliebluesdancerdiaries.blogspot.com/2014/12/grandest-of-them-all.html", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "larger\n$1.00 off ONE Crest Sensi-Relief 4.1 oz or larger\n$1.00 off Vidal Sassoon Shampoo or Conditioner\n$1.00 off ONE Head & Shoulders Product\n$1.00 off ONE Herbal Essences Styling Aid\n$1.00 off Herbal Essences Shampoo or Conditioner\n$1.00 off ONE Crest BE", "link": "http://www.creativecouponing.com/new-month-new-printable-coupons/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 1, "labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "#Sponsored Enter for a chance to meet @SofiaVergara!

afterschool.\u00a0 When homebound kids start to get stir crazy, let them bounce off the walls, and roll with it, with some safe and energy-burning indoor tumbling.\n\u201cTumbling is a great way for kids to burn off energy and learn new skills,\u201d says Carrie Spender, Education Outreach Program Coordinator for Tumbl Trak, makers of a variety of mats for homes and institutions.\n\u201cKids will bounce on the bed, the couch and sometimes \u2018off the walls,\u2019 so set up a place in your house where they can do this safely,\u201d says Spender. \u201cClear away any unsafe obstacles like lamps and sharp furniture that can cause injury, and use proper matting.\u201d\n\nWith a few ground rules and pointers, teaching kids basic tumbling skills can be safe and easy.\nFirst, talk with your kids about key body safe zones.\u00a0 Gently warn kids of the risks of hurting their neck, head or back, and show them how to move safely while protecting these areas.\nBasic moves to avoid injury include tucking the chin toward the chest to protect the neck when rolling, bending the knees slightly to absorb impact when landing feet first, and safe falling or rolling backward with the arms crossed across the chest or above the head, instead of reaching back to break a fall, which is a major cause of wrist, elbow and shoulder injuries.\u00a0 These safety moves are great for the playground too.\nOnce safety basics are down, begin with the fundamentals.\u00a0 Spender suggests playing a pre-tumble game, such as singing \u201chead, shoulders knees and toes\u201d to warm-up the muscles before activity, and also to teach anatomy awareness.\u00a0 Another warm-up and strengthener is a log roll, where kids lie with a straight body, arms over the head, palms together, and roll sideways.\nWhen muscles are limber and ready, begin with the most common first tumbling move, a forward roll.\n\nForward Roll\nThe easiest way to begin a front roll is standing with feet apart.\u00a0 Next, bend and place hands on the floor keeping the seat high in the air.\u00a0 Have your child look toward the knees with the chin tucked to the chest.\u00a0 Then, lean forward, lowering the back of the neck toward the ground.\u00a0 Continue the roll onto the back and finally to the seat.\u00a0 Eventually finish the roll on the feet.\n\u201cUnless your kid is Olympics bound, perfection is not the goal,\u201d says Spender.\u00a0 \u201cPointed toes and straight legs are important in competitive gymnastics, but they are not a necessary focus at home.\u201d\nHandstand\nThe next move is the handstand, the building block of more advanced gymnastics moves.\u00a0 A safe handstand begins with strong arms and core.\u00a0 Have kids start with a push up position to see if they can first support some of their body weight with their arms.\u00a0 Gradually have kids move feet to higher levels, putting more and more weight on the hands and arms.\u00a0 Walking feet up a wall, called \u201cspider walk,\u201d with the front of their body facing the wall, is a safe way to gain strength to work up to a handstand.\nHandstand mats, which attach to the back of a door, can be used for practice, to protect both the kid and the door.\n\nCartwheel\nOnce a kid learns a handstand, a cartwheel is a natural progression.\u00a0 A helpful cartwheel starter is a \u201ctick-tock.\u201d Standing with feet apart and arms stretched outward, the child will lean sideways, reaching one hand toward the floor while lifting the opposite foot up off the floor.\u00a0 They touch the hand briefly to the floor, then return to standing position.\u00a0 Once they are ready to cartwheel, they start with hands above head, in a lunge position, and reach forward, placing hands flat on the floor, one hand more forward than the other while kicking the back leg up in the air.\u00a0\u00a0 The back leg will swing up and forward, landing on the other side of the hands.\u00a0 Lift hands off the ground while the second foot lowers toward the floor.\nWaterfall Backward Roll\nBackward rolls may seem basic but they are difficult to learn and commonly taught too early.\u00a0 A replacement is a waterfall backward roll.\u00a0 To learn this skill, a child lies on a bed or couch on his or her back with head toward the edge, with a tumbling mat, or other cushion on the floor.\u00a0 The child reaches hands above the head toward the floor, and creeps the body backward until hands touch the mat on the floor.\u00a0 With hands positioned flat, and arms strong and straight, the child raises feet toward the ceiling, then over head to the floor until child is kneeling, squatting or standing.\nWhile teaching this and all tumbling skills, parents should take their time and talk with kids about how they feel every step of the way.\u00a0 So that kids learn skills and build their strength, parents should avoid the temptation to grab a kid\u2019s ankles and hold them up in a handstand, or, spotting them by holding them while they are learning.\u00a0 On a safe, padded surface,\u00a0 parents can help kids learn tumbling skills by letting them practice on their own t", "link":

Pulse\n\nLie faceup, arms extended at sides. Pull knees to chest; lift head, shoulders and arms. Inhale as you extend right leg, pulsing arms; exhale as you bend right leg and extend left for 1 rep. Do 15 reps.\n2. Tick Tock\n\nStand with feet wider than hips, toes out, knees bent and palms together in front of chest. Keep lower body still as you crunch torso to right. Continue, alternating sides, for 1 minute.\n3. Kickoff\n\nLie faceup with knees bent. Lift hips, squeezing glutes. Extend right leg to ceiling; pulse hips 10 times. Then cross right leg over left 10 times. Repeat on opposite side. Do 2 sets.\n4. Lunge Slide\nStand in front of a counter or table with a towel under left foot. Hold onto the counter as you bend right knee and step left leg back into a lunge. Keeping elbows slightly bent, pull on counter and sit backward, engaging abs. Slide left foot in a semicircle (between 6 o\u2019clock and 9 o\u2019clock) 10 times, then push up and lunge back on right leg 10 times. Repeat on opposite side.\n5. Playful Plank\nStart in a plank with a towel under feet. Keep knees slightly bent as you draw feet in, lifting hips into a pike. Return to start. Next, pull abs in to bring knees under hips. Return to start. Lift right knee to right shoulder, then left knee to left shoulder, for 1 rep. Do 10 reps.\n\nStyling, Taylor McNeill; Hair, Dana Boyer for Oribe Hair Care; Makeup, Holly Gowers for DiorSkin Nude.

Die magischste Zeit des Winters beginnt: die Vorweihnachtszeit!

Die Zentren der St\u00e4dte verwandeln sich in m\u00e4rchenhafte Weihnachtsm\u00e4rkte, von denen wir im Winter einfach nicht genug bekommen. Wir freuen uns richtig drauf und k\u00f6nnen es kaum erwarten, den ersten Christkindlmarkt zu besuchen. Deshalb pr\u00e4sentieren wir euch f\u00fcnf ganz besondere Weihnachtsm\u00e4rkte, denen ihr in diesem Jahr auf jeden Fall einen Besuch abstatten m\u00fcsst.\n\n\n\n\n      L\u00fcbecker Weihnachtsmarkt: Unterm Lichtermeer!    \n\n      N\u00fcrnberger Christkindlmarkt: Traditionen hautnah erleben!    \n\n      Hamburger Weihnachtsmarkt: Kunstvoll sch\u00f6n!    \n\n      Weihnachtsmarkt und Weihnachtswald Goslar: Magisches Winterwunderland!    \n\n      Ludwigsburger Barock-Weihnachtsmarkt: Zauberhafte Weihnachten    \n\n\n\n\nL\u00fcbecker Weihnachtsmarkt: Unterm Lichtermeer!\nDer historische Weihnachtsmarkt von L\u00fcbeck ist ein kleines Schmuckst\u00fcck, das ihr unbedingt gesehen haben solltet. Der m\u00e4rchenhafte Markt spielt sich vor der Kulisse des L\u00fcbecker Rathauses ab und ist von einem zeltartigen Gespann aus Lichterketten \u00fcberdacht, die den Weihnachtsmarkt in schummeriges Licht h\u00fcllen und zum gem\u00fctlichen Bummeln einladen. Zudem ist der Weihnachtsmarkt das Paradies f\u00fcr alle Marzipan-Fans: Hier findet ihr das original L\u00fcbecker Marzipan von Niederegger \u2013 auch f\u00fcr die Nicht-Marzipan-Esser unter euch dank kunstvoll hergestellter Marzipan-Figuren und -torten ein wahrer Augenschmaus. Ab dem 27.11.17 k\u00f6nnt ihr den Weihnachtsmarkt aufsuchen.\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f#tyskland #rodzina #weekend #swiatecznyklimat #niemcy#julestemning\nEin Beitrag geteilt von Kasia \ud83e\udd13 (@kasiazdrawna) am 3. Dez 2016 um 7:14 Uhr\n\n\n\nZur\u00fcck zur \u00dcbersicht\n\n\n\n\n\nN\u00fcrnberger Christkindlesmarkt: Traditionen hautnah erleben!\nDer N\u00fcrnberger Christkindlesmarkt ist einer der gr\u00f6\u00dften und bekanntesten Weihnachtsm\u00e4rkte Deutschlands. Kein Wunder: Er \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigt mit seiner majest\u00e4tischen Sch\u00f6nheit einfach jeden Besucher! Die N\u00fcrnberger Altstadt wird in goldene Lichter gekleidet und in ein m\u00e4rchenhaftes St\u00e4dtchen aus Holzbuden, h\u00f6lzernen Nussknackern und romantischen Krippen verwandelt. Ein Must-Try sind die original N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrstchen im Br\u00f6tchen sowie die Lebkuchen \u2013 einfach k\u00f6stlich! Was ihr weiterhin auf keinen Fall verpassen solltet: die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Feuerzangenbowle der Welt \u2013 nicht nur wahnsinnig lecker, sondern wirklich ein Spektakel sondergleichen. Der Christkindlesmarkt \u00f6ffnet seine Pforten am 01.12.17 und l\u00e4dt von da an zum gem\u00fctlichen Bummeln und Schlemmen ein.\n\nZur\u00fcck zur \u00dcbersicht\n\n\n\n\n\nHamburger Weihnachtsmarkt: Kunstvoll sch\u00f6n!\nDer historische Weihnachtsmarkt vor dem atemberaubenden Hamburger Rathaus ist einfach magisch: Von Roncalli betrieben steht er ganz unter dem Motto \u201eKunst statt Kommerz\u201c und \u00fcberzeugt mit viel Kunsthandwerk. Vor allem die Spielzeuggasse lockt mit handgefertigten Waren und Freuden f\u00fcr Gro\u00df und Klein. Die gem\u00fctlichen Holzh\u00fctten bieten eigenen Rathausplatz-Gl\u00fchwein, leckere S\u00fc\u00dfwaren sowie ausgefallene Geschenkartikel an. Das absolute Highlight: der fliegende Weihnachtsmann, der in einem Schlitten auf einer Seilbahn t\u00e4glich um 16:00, 18:00 und 20:00 Uhr quer \u00fcber den Weihnachtsmarkt gleitet. Ein weiterer Vorteil: Vom historischen Markt erreicht ihr fu\u00dfl\u00e4ufig die kleineren Weihnachtsm\u00e4rkte in der M\u00f6nckebergstra\u00dfe, am Jungfernstieg oder am G\u00e4nsemarkt. Die ganze Hamburger Innenstadt ist praktisch ein gro\u00dfer Weihnachtsmarkt und l\u00e4dt euch ab dem 27.11.17 zum weihnachtlichen Zusammensein ein.\n\nZur\u00fcck zur \u00dcbersicht\n\n\n\n\n\nWeihnachtsmarkt und Weihnachtswald Goslar: Magisches Winterwunderland!\nGoslar am Harz ist ein ganz besonderer Ort, der ein einmaliges vorweihnachtliches Vergn\u00fcgen bietet: Die schmalen Gassen, die historischen Fachwerkh\u00e4user und das mittelalterliche Ambiente werden ab dem 29.11.17 durch Weihnachtszauber in einen magischen Ort aus Holz, Tannen, Licht und Christbaumschmuck verwandelt. Das absolute Highlight: der Weihnachtswald inmitten der historischen Altstadt \u2013 \u00fcber 50 Nadelb\u00e4ume werden mit Lichterketten zum Funkeln gebracht und laden zu einem besinnlichen Erlebnis inmitten eines Zauberwalds ein. Besonders sch\u00f6n f\u00fcr Kinder: eine Eisenbahn, die an der Marktkirche durch einen Mini-Weihnachtswald f\u00e4hrt!\n\n\n\nHi there, Goslar  #harzmountains #christmastime #goslar #tistheseason #harz #jollytimes\nEin Beitrag geteilt von Kimberly Beyer (@kimberlybeyer) am 4. Dez 2016 um 4:20 Uhr\n\n\n\nZur\u00fcck zur \u00dcbersicht\n\n\n\n\n\nLudwigsburger Barock-Weihnachtsmarkt: Zauberhafte Weihnachten\nDer romantische Barock-Weihnachtsmarkt in Ludwigsburg ist einer wie keiner: Auf dem barocken Marktplatz wird \u2013 von wundersch\u00f6nen Arkaden ums\u00e4umt \u2013 eine m\u00e4rchenhafte Kulisse aus liebevoll dekorierten St\u00e4nden, wundervoll geschm\u00fcckten Christb\u00e4umen und tausend goldenen L\u00e4mpchen aufgebaut. Anmutige Engel breiten ihre funkelnden Fl\u00fcgel \u00fcber den D\u00e4chern der Marktbuden aus und tauchen diesen kleinen Ort in Magie und Besinnlichkeit. Besonders f\u00fcr Familien ist der Weihnachtsmarkt einen Besuch wert: T\u00e4glich werden lustige Kinderprogramme mit Puppenspiel, Marionettentheater und Zauberei sowie stimmungsvolle Musik geboten \u2013 ein einmaliges Erlebnis f\u00fcr Gro\u00df und Klein. Der m\u00e4rchenhafte Ort l\u00e4sst nichts zu w\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig und er\u00f6ffnet seine Tore am 23.11.2017.\n\n\n\nSo festive and cute  #christmasmarket\nEin Beitrag geteilt von S A R A H S.

It's mostly Fox, but often times people ask us about our hair (or Matt's lack of it!). We're working on a full YouTube video behind Matt's decision to shave his head, but for now we're gonna dive into what we do on a monthly / weekly / daily basis to keep our hair & beard cut and groomed and proper. Maybe worth saying upfront: we don't do anything all *that* special or expensive, and we are 100% not experts in this field - just two guys who don't like spending a lot of money but want to look good!\n\nBeauIt took me a solid 4 years to discover what I should be doing with my hair. It's extremely thick with a coarse texture and tends to grow directly out, creating a mushroom head effect if I don't keep it styled and get it cut every 3 - 4 weeks. NOT CUTE Y'ALL. My favorite cut for my hair is a super high 2-1-0 fade, with just a trim up top. I usually request that the top gets some weight taken out of it - which is typically done with thinning shears. My hair grows back extremely fast, but I've found the high fade helps keep it looking proper for a longer period of time, just to kinda keep the troll doll look at bay. As for hair care, I try to treat my hair minimally as I've found too much product tends to dry my hair out and gets it real fluffy which is notttt what I'm looking to do. For most of my life I thought I had to wash my hair every shower (so, every day), as part of the whole head-shoulders-knees-toes hygienic routine. Now that I'm a certified GayAdultMan I've learned that's definitely not necessary and wash my hair three times a week, which has totally helped keep my hair under control and not too dry or *fluffy*.I use just a small amount of generic tea tree shampoo followed by some scrubbing of my hair and face with Kalamazoo by Lush (and then rinsing, obvi). After I get out of the shower, I towel dry my hair to where it's just slightly damp. Then I use a few drops of Oi oil by Davines which helps weigh it down a bit, control the frizz, and add a bit of sheen. It also smells SO GOOD. The Oi oil is the most expensive part of my hair routine and costs around $23 for a 50 ml bottle. I'm cheap, yes it's true. Finally, after I've done the Oi oil, I use a bit of Queen Bee by Lush. It's basically a brick of cocoa butter, beeswax, and honey. You just crumble a bit into your hands and rub it together to melt. Then, just run through your hair to coat it thoroughly and you're good to go. I was a bit conservative with it at first because putting a shit ton of literal beeswax in my hair felt like a bad idea, but I've begun to use quite a bit more (think - larrrge pea) and haven't found my hair to become greasy or stiff, and instead it gives me a ton of control over shaping and styling.Oh and about my \"beard\"??? I shave my face every few days because my facial hair is a sad, sad story and no one needs to see what two weeks of growth looks like on me. K, next.MattUp top my daily routine is easy! The decision to go bald has definitely saved me a lot of time getting ready not having to go to all the lengths Beau does. I started realizing I was thinning on the crown of my head about five years ago, and it took me until last year to stop trying to hide it and just embrace the bald and bearded look.The actual act of shaving my head is a little time consuming, but I only need to do it once or twice a week. When I first started chopping it all off, I preferred going to a barber and having them shave my head for me (very helpful for those parts you can't really see), but at around $30 a trip I finally decided I could bite the bullet and learn to do it myself. I always make sure to shave my head right out of a very hot shower, or if I don't have the time, I soak a towel in hot water and wrap it around my head to soften my scalp and open up the hair follicles. Then I just apply shave gel (we're a Harry's household) and gently go at it the same way you would shave any other part of yourself. I make Beau double check that I've gotten all the spots I can't see before rinsing off in cold water and applying Perricone MD CBx for Men Soothing Post-Shave Treatment all over.For my beard, adjustable trimmers are my BBFL. I can do pretty much everything I need with just 3 guards, but I use a 20-setting trimmer because I love an opportunity to be extra. I go in with the number 3 guard over the whole beard first. Then I need to fade the sideburns up to my bald head, which I do by using the 2 guard starting about half an inch from where the sideburns end, then the 1 guard halfway between that, and then no guard halfway between that. I put the 2 guard back on to go over my mustache because I think that looks better just a touch shorter (I'm a details queen).I take a Harry's Truman razor to my cheeks (with shaving cream, always!) to straighten the hair line from ear down to chin, and then use the razor again to clean up my neck. Back to the trimmers, I fade out the neck line just like I faded out the sideburns \u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0fup there.Finally, I take the razor and VERY carefully get rid of the few mustache hairs at the very top that sort of grow into the nostrils? Like yuck, who thought those were a good idea there? Honestly, this is a really small detail that is probably totally not necessary, but I feel like that tiny separation helps create a bit of space to make my mustache stand out better.And that's pretty much it! As always, let us know if you've got any more questions / comments / concerns (lol)!- xoxo Matt & Beau  ", "link": "http://www.probablythis.com/blog/hair-beard-routine", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0], "model_decision": null}, {"text": "\ud83c\udf80 K I E L H\u2019 S \ud83c\udf80\nAd Ottobre sono stata da @kiehlsitaly a Napoli per eseguire il test della pelle ( che potete fare gratuitamente nelle boutiques KIELH\u2019S ) per poi studiare quale routine di prodotti si adattasse di pi\u00f9 alle mie esigenze.\nSiccome sono stata un po\u2019 indolente, abbiamo scoperto oggi con il check che purtroppo la situazione non \u00e8 cambiata affatto.

Little things, short lived, but many of them - coughs, fever, eye infections; we nourish them back to full glowing strength & return them to school, only to see them wobble again a wee while later ... as the youngest\u2019s immature immune system does daily battle with the ever evolving bugs & bacteria, we add our daily boosters: homemade sourdough; miso; cacao; turmeric & nigella; elderberry; multibiotics from @wildnutritionltd; aconite 200c; stewed apples; raw honey & cups & cups of anti-inflammatory tea... we do what we know. It\u2019s all we have.\n\ud83d\udc99 And for this tired mama & non-stopping papa? Well... a wish for ease; a bow to the mat; a daily meditation & laughter whenever we can - \u201cit\u2019s been a rough month!\u201d the Mister & I say to one another... as we understand, yet again, that this too shall pass... the unpredictable now predictable - the children our ups & downs, our highs & lows... we do our best... we make time because if we don\u2019t, all the joy of life fades away, and we are left only with duty.\n\ud83d\udc99 So, to all those parents by their babes\u2019 bedsides, make a promise to your self: once all is well, drill down, deep into the bedrock & replenish your own well. And read @suzyreading\u2019s utterly utterly brilliant book for myriad ways to do just that, every single day; rough or smooth \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc Tagged: @kikki.k, @pukkaherbs", "link": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BeEFR-ElrIA/", "lang": "en", "mturker": 0, "labels": [0], "model_decision": null}]
