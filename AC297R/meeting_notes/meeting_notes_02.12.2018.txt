Agenda: what the team did during the meeting.

– The team presented the slides for the first milestone. 
- The team provided insights about Tribe Dynamics' business activities.
- The team described models, data available, downstreem pipeline and performances.
- The team discussed the contents for the scope of the work.

Next Steps: what the team is doing now.

- The team is defining three baseline models to use as a benchmark for comparison with more sophisticated models.
- The team is waiting for a new dataset that will allow to train the baseline models and measure their performances.
- The team is doing research on the Transfer Learning

Common Ground Knowledge: what the team's members agreed on sharing knowledge.

- The team is going to check for a common understanding of the main Natural Language Processing methods and Machine Learning tasks:
	a) bag of words
	b) unigram, bigrams, n-grams
	c) Word Embedding
	d) Logistic Regression \ Naive Bayes Classifier

Comments: what the team must integrate into the downstream pipeline.

- The team is going to investigate how human being can interact with machine learning in the downstreem pipeline.
	a) how human interventaion in machine learning tasks can improve the performance and transparency?
	b) when can we have human providing feedbacks on the task performed?
