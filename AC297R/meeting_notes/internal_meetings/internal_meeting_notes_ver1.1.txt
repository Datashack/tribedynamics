Agenda for next three weeks

1 – Scrape N posts from a fixed social media (IG, Twitter?), both in English and Italian, that contain the hashtag #maybelline

2 – From these N posts, which we know (for sure) that are related to Maybelline, select 20-50% of them and from these remove ‘#maybelline’ 
3 - Do some kind of preprocessing on these posts, which includes stopwords removal and stemming, with any Python library we want (@WP here is the reminder for the link :grin:)

4 – Encode the data with bag of words (CountVectorizer) or whatever
5 
5 – Code the actual algorithms, which are the following:
	a) Tribe’s model -> Giant vocabulary of both Italian and English words -> n-grams + logistic regression 
-    
	b) Translation model -> Vocabulary built on English words plus the addiction of Italian words that correspond to the most frequent English ones in the vocabulary -> Apply any classifier on this vocabulary (or n-grams + logistic regression again?)
    
	c) Build one classifier per language, so one for English (only English vocabulary) and one for Italian (only for Italian vocabulary)
6 - Install pytorch and torchtext
7 - Google slides with EDA summary and baseline models benchmarks

Work done

1 - Selected the brand 'Dove' - over 106 brands - to build baseline models beacuse has a good amount of Italian and English posts. 
2 - EDA (+ unbalanced class)
3 - Built n-grams logistic regression model trained on the new dataset (i.e. brand 'Dove')
4 - Established the software architecture (see readme.md in the github repo for more details)
5 - Added scripts for computing three metrics we might need for evaluating models (accuracy, auc plot and precision recall plot - see model_eval_metrics.py in the github repo for more details)
6 - Naive Bayes Classifiers for english and italian posts

Study - Ground knowledge

1 - Word Embedding
2 - AUC ROC curves

Questions:


1 - Why do we have a list of labels? Does it mean that it has been given by multiple people on the same post?

2 - Why is the 'model_decision' column always equal to None? Not that we necessarily need this column for our current purpose, but at least it would help to calculate the baseline which we are aiming for
3 - Which languages are largely similar to italian ?

4 - What is our clean software design document that we will adhere to ? ipython sucks for scalable software design

5 - How a model decision compare to another increase business costs?
