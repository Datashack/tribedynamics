# Tribe Dynamics - Cross-Lingual Text Classifiers

Our project report can be found here - https://datashack.github.io/tribedynamics/ (the HTML code for the report can be found in gh-pages branch. We did not add it to master branch for clarity since it had a lot of images and other code )



Special thanks to https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE for the pre-trained embeddings.
